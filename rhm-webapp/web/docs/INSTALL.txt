Installation instructions for the Harvest Repository Manager software v@VERSION@.

These instructions are for installing from a WAR file, not from source.

To install and run the Harvest Repository Manager software you must have the following:
  
1. Harvest Repository Manager Web application software (hm.war or hm deployment directory).
2. Tomcat v6.x
3. Java 8 (should work with Java 6 and 7 too)
4. An installation of the Digital Collection System (DCS) that contains one or more ncs_collect records (used to configure where to harvest from)
5. MySQL - To house the harvested records repository



Step 1: Download and install an instance of the DCS and
create one or more ncs_collect records that define the OAI settings
for an the collection. The DCS is available at:
https://wiki.ucar.edu/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=78352766

Step 2: Download and install a Tomcat servlet container on your server. 
To install Tomcat, follow the instructions available from Apache at
http://tomcat.apache.org/

Step 3: Place the file 'hm.war' into the 'webapps' directory found in    
your Tomcat installation. 'webapps' is the default location where Tomcat 
expects to find web applications. Alternatively, you may build and deploy
the software directly to Tomcat from the project source files

Step 4: Install MySQL and configure the necessary database schemas and a
DB user account with read/write access to the these schemas (db user and password
will be configured in the webapp configuration step).

Follow the instructions here to set up the DB schemas and tables:
https://wiki.ucar.edu/display/nsdlto/Installation+and+Dev+Setup

A copy of the above is also in the project docs: web/docs/Database-and-app-InstallationandDevSetup-instructions.pdf

- 'hm_repository' - The tables in this DB schema are the repository that hold the
latest harvested and normalized records from all collections

- 'harvest' - Tables in the schema are used to stage the most recent harvest and logs

- 'harvest_workspace' - Schema used for temporary tables during a harvest


Step 5: Start or restart Tomcat. Upon startup the first time, Tomcat will
automatically unpack the hm.war archive, creating a directory and 
application context named 'hm'.
  
Step 6: The Harvest Repository Manager software should now be running. Launch a
web browser and type in the URL to the tomcat server and context, for example
http://localhost:8080/hm/

Step 7: Configure the harvest manager webapp settings. The default settings for the software are defined in the Web Application deployment
descriptor file found at (${tomcat}/webapps/hm/WEB-INF/web.xml)  - see the context parameters (<context-param> elements).
The purpose of each setting is described in detail in that file.
Edit the default settings to configure your local installation (settings should be placed in ${tomcat}/conf/server.xml
or ${tomcat}/conf/Catalina/localhost/hm.xml).

Step 8: Configure the 'records' context, which is used to display links to access the raw downloaded harvested records
and error messages that appear in the for the 'Harvested Records' tab in the Harvest Repository Manager:

	To configure the 'records' context for Tomcat 6, do as follows:

	a. Copy the file ${tomcat}/webapps/hm/records_tab_directory_listing.xsl to the ${tomcat}/conf directory
       ${tomcat}/conf/records_tab_directory_listing.xsl

       Note: As of Tomcat 6.0.44, this XSL file must be in the conf directory, not the webapps/hm directory

	b. Edit the default context config file ${tomcat}/conf/web.xml

		- Add an init-param 'globalXsltFile' to configure the ${tomcat}/conf/records_tab_directory_listing.xsl
		style sheet for directory listings:
	
			<init-param>
				<param-name>globalXsltFile</param-name>
				<param-value>/INSERT-PATH-TO-TOMCAT/conf/records_tab_directory_listing.xsl</param-value>
			</init-param>
			
		- Set the listing param to 'true':
		
			<init-param>
				<param-name>listings</param-name>
				<param-value>true</param-value>
			</init-param>		
		
	c. Add a Tomcat context '/records' in server.xml mounted to the root folder of the ingest records directory (the directory
	where the ingested files are saved by the ingest process):
	
			<Context path="/records" docBase="/usr/local/ingest"
					debug="0"
					reloadable="false">
			</Context>	
	
	d. In the Harvest Repository Manager context config in server.xml (/hm), add the attribute crossContext="true":
	
		<Context path="/hm" docBase="/hm" debug="0" reloadable="true" crossContext="true">
			... other params here
		</Context>

		
Step 8 (optional): Configure apache to proxy http requests through to the Tomcat Harvest Repository Manager (/hm) and
records (/records) contexts. This can be achieved with mod_proxy, mod_jk, or mod_proxy_ajp (documentation not
included here). Note that when using mod_proxy, an additional configuraion must be placed
in Tomcat's server.xml <Connector> (for both port 80 and 443) to define the 
proxyName and proxyPort attributes, for example:

    <Connector port="8380" maxHttpHeaderSize="8192"
               maxThreads="150" minSpareThreads="25" maxSpareThreads="75"
               enableLookups="false" redirectPort="8443" acceptCount="100"
               connectionTimeout="30000" disableUploadTimeout="true" 
               proxyName="harvest.nsdl.org"
               proxyPort="80" />
