Instructions for building the Harvest Repository Manager software v@VERSION@ from source.

Quick instructions: 
--------------------------------------------

This software may be built using Ant. If you are already using Ant
and Tomcat 6, building the software is a three step process:
1. Obtain the harvest-repository-project module (https://github.com/NCAR/harvest-repository-project)
2. Set the ant property 'catalina.home' to point to your Tomcat installation.
3. From the harvest-repository-project directory, execute the ant 'deploy' target.

This will build the software and place it in a directory named 'harvest_manager'
inside your Tomcat webapps directory.


Detailed instructions:
--------------------------------------------

To build the Harvest Repository Manager software from source you must have the following:
  
1. harvest-repository-project - the Harvest Repository Manager software source code directory
2. Tomcat version 6.x (available at http://tomcat.apache.org/)
3. Ant (available at http://ant.apache.org/)
4. Java 8


Build instructions:

These instructions assume you will be working in a UNIX command-line environment.
The software can also be built on Windows but specific instructions are not 
provided here.

1. Obtain the harvest-repository-project source directory (see above).

2. Obtain and install all the required tools (Java, Ant, Tomcat).

3. Place the harvest-repository-project directory into a single directory.
For example:
 # cd ~/my_build_area
 # ls 
   harvest-repository-project
	  
4. cd into the harvest-repository-project directory.
  # cd harvest-repository-project

5. Create a file named build.properties in the my_build_area directory 
(alternatively this can be placed in your home directory).

6. Edit the build.properties file and set the poperty catalina.home to
point to your intallation of Tomcat, for example:
catalina.home = /home/username/dev/apache-tomcat-5.5.12

See the build.xml file located in harvest-repository-project for information on the 
properties settings.

7. Execute the Ant deploy command.
  # ant deploy
You should see a number of messages in your terminal. Once complete
you should see a message like:
    BUILD SUCCESSFUL
    Total time: 36 seconds

8. The software will be built into a directory named harvest_manager inside your
Tomcat webapps directory. After (re)starting Tomcat you will be able to
access the software at the URL http://localhost:8080/harvest_manager/
(substitute localhost with your domain name if appropriate).
