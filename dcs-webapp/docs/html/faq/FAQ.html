<div class="jlo">Most of the below pertain to the Collection Browser page, while
some do not. We'll have to figure out where this list should go, possibly
splitting it up</div>

<h3>Questions</h3>
<span class="q">Add Collections:</span> Click the <span class="ui">create a new
collection</span> button.

<p><span class="q">Change collection order:</span> Each column heading name
(format, num records, num done, num working) can be used to sort the collection
list. Name and format are alphabetical order while the other columns sort on
number (highest to lowest).

<p><span class="q">Create individual metadata records:</span> Individual
metadata records for any collection can be created by clicking on the <span
class="ui">create</span> button.

<p><span class="q">What is the metadata format of a collection:</span> The
format column indicates the metadata format of individual records within the
collection. For further explanation of these formats, see the <a
href="http://www.dlese.org/Metadata/" targe="_blank">DLESE metadata website</a>.

<p><span class="q">What do the num columns mean:</span> These columns indicate
the total number of records, the number of records done, completed or
accessioned into the collection and the number of records that are incomplete
and not accessioned into the collection.

<p><span class="q">What does export mean:</span> Export means taking the number
of done records and making them available for use outside this tool or for other
systems and services. Use <span class="ui">export</span> when ready to make the
collection available to DLESE.

<p><span class="q">How to see/edit/change status of items in a
collection:</span> Determine what collection the record is in. Click on the
hyperlinked collection name. This takes you to the <span class="ui">Collection
Browser</span> where you can view, edit, create or change the status of
records. Click on the <span class="ui">view</span>, <span
class="ui">edit</span>, <span class="ui">create</span>, <span
class="ui">delete</span> buttons on the actual record status to perform further
actions.

<div class="jlo">The above will need to be revised:-)</div>

<p><span class="q">How do I edit a record:</span> See the How to see items in a
collection.

<p><span class="q">How to move a record from working to done:</span> See the how
to see/edit/change status of items in a collection.  

<div class="jlo">"move from
working to done" will only make sense to someone who is used to the old DCS
...</div>

<p><span class="q">How do I change which collections discovery is performed
over:</span> Click on the <span class="ui">Settings</span> link and then select
<span class="ui">Repository Settings</span>. A table appears that allows you to
enable or disable a collection in discovery.
