Instructions for building the DCS/NCS software v@VERSION@ from source.
    
To build the DCS from source you must have the following:
  
1. dcs-webapp - the configuration and jsp files for DCS interface
2. dlese-tools-project - the DLESE Java libraries source code directory
3. dds-webapp - contains the repository level functionality
4. joai-project - contains OAI provider functionality
4. Tomcat version 5.x (available at http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/index.html)
5. Ant (available at http://ant.apache.org/). Available for Windows in the jEdit
code editor (available at http://www.jedit.org/ - Once installed, install the AntFarm plugin
using jEdit's plugin manager).
6. Java2 platform v1.4 or later (available from IBM at http://www6.software.ibm.com/dl/lxdk/lxdk-p
or from Sun at http://java.sun.com/j2se/). Note that Java2 comes pre-installed on 
Mac OS X (Jaguar or later).


Build instructions:

1. Obtain the dcs-webapp, dlese-tools-project, dds-webapp, and joai-project source code directories (see above).

2. Obtain and install all the required tools - Tomcat, Ant and Java (see above).

3. Place the dcs-webapp, dlese-tools-project and vocab-ui-project directories into a single directory
where you will be developing the software.

5. Create a file named build.properties in the directory containing the projects 
(alternatively this can be placed in your home directory).

6. Edit the build.properties file to include the required and optional Ant
properties used in the build. The required and optional Ant properties are
listed at the top of the build.xml file at the root level of the dds-webapp.
For example, you could define the ${app.name} property to change the name of the
deployed application.

7. Edit the Tomcat server.xml file (located in the Tomcat conf directory)
and create a context descriptor for schemedit (as described in INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS.txt)
to overide default values for a custom configuration. (Note: this step is
not necessary, but it is highly encouraged for long-term use).

8. Execute the Ant deploy command (available in jEdit or your own Ant tool)
You should see a number of messages in your terminal. Once complete
you should see a message like:
    BUILD SUCCESSFUL
    Total time: 36 seconds

9. The software will be built into a directory named schemedit inside your
Tomcat webapps directory. After (re)starting Tomcat you will be able to
access the software at the URL http://localhost:8080/schemedit/ 
(substitute localhost with your domain name if appropriate).
