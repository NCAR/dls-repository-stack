Changes in 2.10.0

- The code projects for DDS, DCS, Harvest Manager, Java libraries, and frameworks-project
are now combined in a single repository (stack) in GitHub. The joai-project is no longer a dependency.
Top-level project directories  were renamed to better match their identity.
-- Renamed all Java packages from org.dlese.dpc.* to edu.ucar.dls.*

- This file describes release changes for the DCS webapp. See the top-level README docs for global change notes.


Changes in 2.9.8

- Updated and verified to run under Java 8 and Tomcat 7 (also Java 6,7). Does NOT run under Tomcat 6 (search page broken)
- Fixed issue with temporaty file clashes when running multiple instances of DCS/DDS in a single Tomcat container
(set unique contextParam DDS_UUID for each instance)

Changes in 2.9.7

- Standards Selector works around ADN standards implementation

Changes in 2.9.6 (released to SourceForge 7/15/2014)
- Added repository analytics tool from the dds, along with the UI for it

Changes in 2.9.5 (released to SourceForge 6/18/2014)
- AssetManager - input helper to support uploading of files. Implementation
is currently compatible with CCS only.
- Passwords encrypted using SHA-1 Base64
- ASN Standards cache can be rebuilt from admin configuration page

Changes in 2.9.4 (released to SourceForge 7/31/2013)

- Schemas having scheme of "https" can now be processed

Changes in 2.9.3 (released to SourceForge 9/26/2012)
- OSM Affiliation helper now handles external orgs (instName), even if it isn't in the controlled vocab.
- cow_item framework (which defines attributes for asn element) supports asn standards service
- NLDR tools page contains tool to update affected records for vocabs frameworks
-Added the ability to configure the default search field used by the query parser in the Search API and elsewhere 
when no search field is explicilty specified. This is normally set to 'default' but can now be overridden to 
specify a custom field if desired.

Changes in 2.9.2.3
- Debugged support for repeating substitution groups
- Union date type values now parsed wrt local time zone

Changes in 2.9.2.1

Changes in 2.9.1 (released to SourceForge 4/3/2012) 

Custom support for LAR framework: virtualPageLists and LAR standards selection

ASN Standards changes
- IDs changed from purl-form (http://purl.org/ASN/resources/S1136B91) to new form: http://asn.jesandco.org/resources/S114341B
- ASN Document Catalog now cached using new ASN Webservices (http://asn.jesandco.org/content/asn-web-services-overview)
- ASN standards updated to accomodate comm-core-specific ASN fields ("comments" and "statementNotation")
- Increases token length for indexing URLs

The concept of collectionOfCollectionRecords is introduced. This long name denotes a collection containing
collection-level metadata records (as opposed to the normal item-level metadata). collectionOfCollectionRecords
are configured as context params, and are associated with metadataHandles, which are stored in the DcsDataRecord
for the individual collection-level records. This association between record and metadataHandle is established
in the WorkFlowServices class, which obtains a handle from a handleService and writes it to the DcsDataRecord
when the status of the metadataRecord is set to Done.

NLDR-specific functionality
- dcsosmIsRevision field requires presense of /record/general/title/@submission
- nldr export performs export on all osm records (even if they haven't changed) so that embargoes are managed correctly.

Changes in 2.9.0 (released to SourceForge 7/12/2011) 

Underlying DDS Development
- the DDS system that provides repository and indexing functionality has seen a
lot of development, and has a slightly different configuration. See "UPDATING_to_2.9.txt"
for Required configuration changes. And don't forget to reindex once you start
back up after updating configurations.

ASN Standards Management
- Streamlined ASN Standards Service configuration (see "UPDATING_to_2.9.txt" for Required configuration changes)
- ASN Standards Management UI - allows you to edit the set of ASN Standards Documents that are shown to 
catalogers in the metadata editor.
- ASN Standards Service fetches ASN docs on-demand and caches them locally for effeciency.

Customized displays for controlled vocabularies
- Out-of-schema values for controlled vocabs displayed in metadata editor (accomodates cases where invalid
values are contained in records deposited in NCS repository by external apps, such as recommenders or submission
forms)
- Asynchronous display of vocabLayout fields (i.e., fields governed by a "groups", or "vocabLayout" file). This
is useful if you have a fancy inputHelper and don't want to refresh the page unnecessarily.

Repository Level
- Repository Web Services (PutRecord and DeleteRecord) updated to support blocking and syncing with NDR
- Custom export scheme for NLDR in which master osm_collect records are mirrored as dlese_collect records

- new schemaPath value type: type_ahead available for single-select fields governed by controlled vocab. To activate
the type_ahead functionality, create (or modify) a schema path in the framework configuration to have a value
of "type_ahead" for the "valueType" attribute.


Changes in version 2.8.2
- SmartCheckBoxes - hierarchical controlled vocabs in the metadata-editor can be configured
(via the groups file) to automatically check and uncheck anscestors and descendants as appropriate to
support best practices for cataloging to hierarchy.
- Fields and groups files can now be specified by absolute path in listing files.
- Status can now be changed from within editor
- Searching over status_notes, record creator supported
- Redesigned item controls for search results
- Redesigned nav menu for metadata editor
- Configurable "instanceHelp" link that appears in "Help" menu on each page
- Elements can be ordered by a specified attribute (via framework config).
- CollectionCreation allows specification of collectionKey when so configured, and 
  no longer requires both short and long Titles
- "uniqueValue" schemaPaths in framework config define paths that are checked by editor to ensure
  dup values do not occur in any other record in the collection of the record being edited.
- NSDL Collections write ncs:nativeFormat property to collection MDP whether collection is 
  oai-ingested or ncs-managed
- UpdateStatus web service allows the status (label, note, editor) to be updated over the web. Updates
  are written to the NDR when the modified record is part of a collection that is registered with the NDR.
- Errors and warnings produced during framework load are displayed on home page and frameworks settings pages. the
warnings disappear when user clicks "okay" button.

Changes in version 2.8.0
- CAT service interface now recognizes vocabs as GradeRanges (e.g., "High School" -> 9-12)
- NOTE: CAT Service interface refactor now requires modification of framework plugin paths in service configuration file.
- Field Prompts defined in the "fields files" are displayed in the metadata editor.
- Implemented collapsible tag at top level of groups files
- Fix CAT UI bug by making it Thread-safe
- Fixed Search field bug that precluded using index fields as part of "raw" search
- Fixed bug where statuses containing blank spaces were not properly handled
- Fixed pager bug that added extra (blank) page in some conditions
- Implemented Copy/Move functionality (single and batch).
- Batch operations now only available when recordBatch is result of search over SINGLE COLLECTION
- Added support for Ldap and Ucar/ucas authentication
- Added ListFields and ListTerms web service requests to service explorer
- Limit manipulation of list of records to operated upon for batch ops
- revamped search to better support lucene query syntax and preserve search state

- metadata-editor guarded exits implemented using ajax

ToDo:
- Eliminate dependence on DLESE Schemas

Changes in version 2.7.11
- updated NDR UI to accomodate handles produced by local NDR installations (which don't have a "2200/" prefix)
- all javascript code now loads ndrGlobals, which contains a "log" function that replaces all calls to 
	"console.log", etc. This log function traps errors produced when console.log is not defined.
- CAT UI now accomodates "subject" field when this is exposed by frameworks.
- changed default logo to 'eduPak'
- fixed xpath sorting to account for indexing to support smile inputHelpers, which can add many elements at 
	one to a document.
- fixed search bug where the paging didn't work for search strings containing more than one word

Changes in version 2.7.10
- user data is now managed as individual files (old-style users.xml is automatically converted at system startup)
- framework-specific validation for "special fields" - i.e., those that
information beyond that contained in the schema
- information about the current user can be automatically inserted in newly
created metadata records. This is configured in the framework-configuration
- collection names now xml-escaped to allow collection names to contain special
chars
- best practices link labels are configurable in the framework-configuration.
- vocabLayout scheme now supports selectable, collapsible groups as well as improved
column formating.
- default MuiLoaderFile is now an empty version (causing the MUI to load
nothing) by default. NCS admins are encouraged to use the "vocabLayout"
scheme rather than the MUI to customize layout of controlled vocab fields.
- framework config schema version is now v_0-0-8. New elements include "userInfo", "bestPracticesLabel", and
a combo input for the "renderer" element.

Changes in version 2.7.9
- Key for google maps api, used by bounding box inputHelper, is now configured in the context descriptor,
and inputHelpers call "gmapBoundingBox.jsp", which has replaced "gmapBoundingBox.html"
- Eliminated remaining hardcoded references to "xsd" as schema namespace prefix
- Added a small "wedge" icon to the collection name "Home", "Manage Collections", and 
"Collections Settings" pages to indicate which collections are written to NDR.
- Added library_dc to oai_dc transform.
- NdrToolkit jar added, making NdrToolkit functionality available
- Prototyped "upload to NDR" input widget that writes a uploaded file to the NDR and returns the URL
  to that content in the NDR.
- fixed controller bug which accessed session information in a non-thread-safe manner.
- added catalogingInfoLabel property allowing label of catalogingInfo link to be configurable
- fixed best practices bug in "create_collection" page
- Improved error handling with MetaExtract service. User can now submit URLs that MetaExtract cannot
handle, and the system simply builds a blank record.
- fixed "user edit" bugs (form autofill, validation forwarding, disallowed "guest" user to edit user info)
- added support for msp2 framework (framework config, xpath indexing, jsp search and view synopses)
- fixed pager bug in which sometimes the paging links in search view became corrupt
- updated suggestion criteria controls
- filter empty elements from MetaExtract responses 

Changes in version 2.7.8
- fixed XSL transform bug affecting transforms from dlese_collect, dlese_anno to nsdl_dc
- fixed uniqueURL bug introduced with xml field indexing
- changed NDR configuration to require ndrApiBaseUrl param (ndrServer param is no longer used)
- added progress indicator for threaded operations (validate and ndrSync). there are still some
other operations that could benefit from progress indicator.
- smile's bounding box tool now configured for ncs_item and ncs_collect (but this line is commented out in the 
respective framework configuration files)

Changes in version 2.7.7
- Stemming now supported in search queries
- "inputHelper" mechanism implemented (beta) to allow 3rd party extensions to metadata editor for
  configured fields (Smile's geo-footprint tool being the first example)
- fixed combo-union input mechanism to properly recognize schema namespace
- added templates and examples in support of NCS User's Guide (coming soon)
- removed the existing conditional configuration scheme.
