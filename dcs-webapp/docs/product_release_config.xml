		<description>
			<![CDATA[ 
			The Digital Collection System (DCS) can be used to generate and manage metadata 
			collections based on XML schemas. The DCS is web-based, supporting distributed 
			collections management with protection against concurrent editing and a roles-based
			permissions scheme. The DCS is currently used as the collection management tool for DLESE.
			
			<br/><br/>

			The NCore version of the DCS (NCS) offers the ability to manage Digital Collections directly 
			in the NSDL Data Repository (NDR).  The NCS is currently used by the NSDL to 
			manage digital collections in the NDR.
						
			<br/><br/>
			
			The software runs in a servlet container such as <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache Tomcat</a>
			and can be installed on Windows, Linux, Mac OS or UNIX systems.
