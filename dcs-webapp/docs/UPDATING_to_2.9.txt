Notes about upgrading to 2.9

1 - Context-descriptor parameter changes (these affect either server.xml or a
stand-alone context descriptor file).

A - the following params are no longer needed and can be removed: 
- indexLocation
- repositoryConfigDir

B - The 'repositoryData' parameter exists, but now the system is using this
directory in a different way. I recommend that you rename your existing
repositoryData dir (when tomcat has been stopped). When tomcat is started up and
reindexed, it will create a new repositoryData directory and populate it
contents.

NOTE: You must "reindex all records" when you start up after making these
changes.

2 - Changes to the way the ASN Standards Service is configured.

A - The 'standardsSuggestionServiceConfig' parameter is no longer used. You can 
delete it or rename it as 'suggestionServiceConfig' and configure as described below.

B - For the ASN Standards service you'll need to make sure that two
context-descriptor params are defined:

- asnStandardsLibrary, and - standardsServiceConfig

See the context_descriptor_template.xml file for more about these parameters.

You will also have to make a new standardsServiceConfig file (see
INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS.txt for details).
