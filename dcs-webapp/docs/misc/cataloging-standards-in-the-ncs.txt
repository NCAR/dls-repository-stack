Cataloging standards in the NCS

the new MSP2 framework is standards-cataloging-friendly because it provides
metadata fields that are closely related to the CAT API parameters.

the subjects field is a large hierarchical list that provides a structure and
vocab choices that can be KEY WORDS in standards documents (Key Concepts)

this secondary, more understandable structure, can allow users to express higher-level groupings,
similar to "strands" and "bands" for less effort. (even a clunky hierarchy can
be better than a freetext box, especially in complex info spaces).

(HECK - this may simply be making a case for making "subject" more important in
the standards-suggesting service, which seems to be a no-brainer, at least in the case of MSP2, ADN,
...)

Should we "constrain (filter, hide) the hierarchy by values in the UI?

UI Notes
- controls for "criteria": reset, dis/enable, edit? (but with edit, we'll have
to be tricky indeed) 
- why not a "mac"-like browser for fields such as msp2's subjects? (then you'd
need a "show only selected" functionality
- would this be a good way of exploring standards documents as well?

Frameworks and the Fields that inform CAT
-all
	- URL
	- Title(s)
	- Description
	- GradeRanges
	- ~keywords
- ncs_item
	- NSESstandard (full-ADN-text that can be feed into query - 
		/record/education/standards/NSESstandard)
	- subject (record/general/subject) - this is a combo-union (vocab + free
	text)
	+ NO KEYWORDS
- adn
	- subject (/itemRecord/general/subjects/subject)
	- KEYWORDS (/itemRecord/general/keywords/keyword
- msp2
	- keyword (/record/general/keyword)
	- subjects
		/record/general/subjects/scienceSubject
		/record/general/subjects/mathSubject
		/record/general/subjects/scienceSubject
	- gsdlSubject? (/record/general/gsdlSubject) - don't know about this. at
		this point would we be stretching it?
- mast
	- gemSubject (/record/general/subjects/gemSubject)
	- gemSubject (/record/general/subjects/otherSubject)
	
SUMMARY
What we're talking about here is adding the ability for a XXX object to "export"
a set of fields, including but not limited to:
- id
- url
- title
- description
- gradeRanges
- keywords
- subjects

these fields need not be available, so UI has to ask for them
