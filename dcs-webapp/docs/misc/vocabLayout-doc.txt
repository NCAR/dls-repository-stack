Description of VocabLayout scheme as of 6/9/2009

VocabLayout is a replacement for the legacy MUI groups functionality.

The VocabLayout scheme is a lightweight version which (like the MUI groups)
supports the layout of controlled vocabs in the metadata editor.

VocabLayout files (aka "groups files") are used to create a structural
organization of vocabulary terms. Vocabs can be grouped into a flat list
(rendered as checkboxes) or a hierarchy of terms with headers and nested headers
and vocabs.

in this document, "leaf" is used to refer to elements in the vocabLayout file
that have no children (these elements have a "vocab" value for the "type"
attribute). "header" is used to refer to elements having children (header
elements have a "group" value for the "type" attribute).

WRAPPING
the "wrap" attribute is used to force a new column in the display. A leaf
element having a "true" value for the wrap attribute will be displayed in a new
column.

likewise, a header element with "wrap" attribute with a value of "true" will
force the display of that header element in new column. NOTE: a "wrap" attribute
should only be used on TOP-LEVEL hierarchy elements!

COLLAPSIBLE headers
header elements having an collapsible="true" attribute are displayed with a
collapse widget which shows/hides the children of the header.

SELECTABLE headers
header elements having a vocab="XX" attribute are displayed with a checkbox,
which, when checked, returns the vocab value.
