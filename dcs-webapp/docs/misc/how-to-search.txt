How to search by URL in the DCS (9/27/2007):

At the top of the "Search" page there is a text input box with three
radio buttons above, labeled "term", "id", and "url". Select the url
button and enter the url you wish to search for into the text input box.
Then hit the "Go" button.

All records having the url you entered as the "primaryUrl" AND
satisfying any other selections you have made in the search form will be
retrieved. To see what other selections you have made, you can open the
individual selection headers, such as "Collection", or you can look
below the search form (but above the result list) for the text following
"Your selections".

The url search described above probably isn't very useful, since it will
only retrieve results that exactly match the provided url. You can also
use "wildcards" to make your searches more flexible. The wildcard
character is the asterisk ("*"), which will match any combinations of
characters.

Important Note: wildcards may not be used as the first character of a search

Wildcard example:
In the DCC collection, with the "url" button selected and no other
search selections, type "h*wetmaap*" (without the quotations) into the
text input box and hit the "go" button. This search will find all
records having "wetmaap" anywhere in the primaryURL field.

(Note: the "h" in "h*wetmaap*" is required since the first character
can't be a wild card. So really, you've found all the records beginning
with the letter "h" and then containing "wetmaap" in the primaryUrl field).
