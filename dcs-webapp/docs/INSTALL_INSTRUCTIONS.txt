The Digital Collection System (DCS) can be used to generate and manage metadata
collections based on XML schemas. The DCS is web-based, supporting distributed
collections management with protection against concurrent editing and a
roles-based permissions scheme. The DCS was originally developed as, and is
currently used as, the collection management tool for the Digital Library for
Earth System Education (DLESE).

The NCore version of the DCS (NCS) offers the ability to manage Digital
Collections directly in the NSDL Data Repository (NDR). The NCS is currently
used by the NSDL to manage digital collections in the NDR.

The software runs in a Apache Tomcat servlet container and can be
installed on Windows, Linux, Mac OS or UNIX systems.

These instructions assume familiarity with Java Servlets, Java Server Pages
(JSP), the Tomcat servlet container and related technologies.

This procedure tested on LINUX, WindowsXP and MacOS v10.6.8

1 - Obtain and install Tomcat (6.x) and Java (1.5.x or 1.6.x) if necessary.
The Tomcat distribution provides instructions within the RUNNING.txt file.

In this document, your Tomcat installation directory will be referred to as
$TOMCAT.

2 - Place the war file (ncs.war) in the webapps directory ($TOMCAT/webapps).
Start/restart Tomcat to unpack the war files and install the web application.

Startup may take a minute - if you want to monitor progress, you can watch the
log file using the following unix command:
	tail \-f \-n100 $TOMCAT/logs/catalina.out

3 - Access the system with your browser at http://localhost:8080/ncs. You will
land on the NCS "Home" page.

NOTE: At the top of the page you will see a message to the effect that the
Sample Collection must be reindexed before it can be accessed. This is normal!

There is no need to stop here and play with the sample collection, but if you
want to try out the tool using the sample collection you may do so after
navigating to the "Manage -> Manage Collections" page and selecting the
"Index" link for Sample Collection.

4 - Configure your NCS Application. A Context Descriptor template can be found
at 'context_descriptor_template.txt' in the distribution directory and also in
the docs/templates directory of the exploded war file. The Context Descriptor
template lists the configuration parameters for the NCS. It describes their
usage and suggests values.

NOTE: The templates directory of the exploded war file contains several template
files referenced in these instructions.

Configuration Steps:

a - Copy the template and either:
- insert within $TOMCAT/conf/server.xml (recommended, see NOTES below) OR
- save as $TOMCAT/conf/Catalina/localhost/ncs.xml.

b - Edit the context descriptor file, whether in server.xml or as a stand-alone
file, as appropriate for your context. As mentioned above, the context
descriptor template list parameters for configuration, explanations of the
parameters, and sample values. If you don't want to configure a given
parameter, comment it out (e.g., <!--  -->).

NOTES:

i - Inserting into $TOMCAT/conf/server.xml
The context descriptor is a single 'Context' element ('<Context>'). This element
is inserted as a child of the <Host> element in server.xml.

ii - Changing the app name (e.g., from "ncs" to "myncs")

	- if you chose to save your context descriptor to its own file, the name of
	this file must match the app directory (${TOMCAT}/webapps/appName).
	
	- in all cases, the "path" attribute of the "Context" element in the context
	descriptor must match the app directory.

Save the context descriptor Restart Tomcat to apply your configurations.

When Tomcat has started, navigate to "Settings -> Indexings" and select the 
"Reindex All" button to ensure the index has been properly initialized. This
action is only necessary when the location of the index and/or metadata files
has changed since the last system start-up.

5 - Set up User Roles and Permissions (Optional)
This optional step allows you to define Authenticated users and to assign them a 
role, which defines the actions they have permission to carry out. Roles are used
to control access to:
- Collections
- System configuration

There are two steps to enable the roles and permissions mechanism:

a - The "authenticationEnabled" parameter must be set to "true" in the context
descriptor.

b - A parameter must be passed to the JVM when it is invoked (i.e., when Tomcat
starts). This parameter tells the JVM where to look for the java class necessary
to support user authentication at login (in the following, $DCS_CONF corresponds 
to the "dcsConf" parameter defined in the Context Descriptor).

	-Djava.security.auth.login.config==$DCS_CONF/auth/ncslogin.config"

In UNIX, the recommended method for passing the required parameter is via a
shell script that will start and stop Tomcat (and can be called by an system
init script if desired). A template for script file can be found at
$TOMCAT/webapps/$APP_NAME/docs/templates/ncs.sh.template. The template contains
the necessary instructions for customizing it to your installation.

For WINDOWS, the recommended method is to pass the parameter via the "Apache
Tomcat Properties" tool (found at $TOMCAT/bin/tomcat5w.exe). After opening the
properties tool, click on the "Java" tab. Add the following line to the "Java
Options" pane (after first replacing $DCS_CONF with the value corresponding to
the parameter defined in the Context Descriptor):

	-Djava.security.auth.login.config==$DCS_CONF\auth\ncslogin.config

Restart Tomcat to apply your change. When you try to access the NCS you will be
challenged for a username and password. Use the following:
	username: root
	password: root!pass

Create and modify users via "Manage -> Manage Users", and specify their access
to collections via "Manage -> Assign Collection Access"
	
NOTE: It is strongly suggested that you change the root user's password!

6 - Configure the ASN Standards Service (optional)

The NCS Standards Service helps catalogers to select and assign educational
standards, such as the ASN Standards (http://asn.jesandco.org/). ASN standards
have the form ("http://purl.org/ASN/resources/S10023EC") which is tedious to
type and which has no semantic meaning. 

The Standards Service displays ASN Standards in textual form, in their
hierarchical structures. When catalogers select a standard, it is inserted into
the metadata as an ASN ID.

The standards service is configured via a single XML file as described below.
The configuration for a particular framework will apply to each
of the collections belonging to that framework. Each framework is configured by
specifying:

- the framework, e.g., 'ncs_item'

- the xpath of the metadata field for which ASN standards will be displayed, e.g.,
'/record/educational/standards/asnID'

- the Standards Documents from which suggestions will be made. There is no need
to manually configure the individual standards documents, this is done through
the "Manager -> Standards" page in the running NCS.

An example standards Configuration file can be found at
templates/standards_service_config.xml. To complete the configuration, perform
the following steps,

a - copy the template file, and save it to disk (e.g.,
$DCS_CONF/standardsServiceConfig.xml). Uncomment the frameworks for which you
would like to use the standards service.

b - set the value for the "standardsServiceConfig" parameter in the
context descriptor to point to the config file. 

c - choose a location for the ASN Standards Library. This is where downloaded
ASN Standards Documents are cached (the NCS downloads ASN Docs as necessary as
you work). Configure the path to the location as the value of the
"asnStandardsLibrary" param in the context descriptor.

NOTE: The standards service may be disabled or enabled on a per-collection basis
via the "Settings -> Collection-Settings" page. By default, the suggestion
service is active if a framework has been configured with a Standards Service.
To change whether the suggestion service is active or not, Navigating to the
settings for the particular collection, and edit the "allowSuggestions" field to
either allow or disallow suggestions.
