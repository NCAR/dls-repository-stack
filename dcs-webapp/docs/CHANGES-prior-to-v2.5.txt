Changes in version 2.5.0
- OAI Provider functionality added

- MetadataVocabOPML support added

Changes in version 2.4.0

- Distribution tested on MAC OS platform (several entity display issues ironed out)

- Metadata fields configured (in framework_config) as "url paths" (valueType in ['url', 'uniqueUrl']) are checked for url syntax upon validation.

- Compositor support - metadata editor now provides more general supports for schema element compositors ("all", "choice" and "sequence") and occurrence constraints ("maxOccurs" and "minOccurs").

- Casaa Suggestor Demo - The suggestion service is integrated into DCS but is not active by default. When ADNv0.7.00 is loaded, 4th level educational content standards are supported.

- Export Web Service - Export operations can now be triggered by "rest-style" web services. The service is guarded by IP, and allows records of specified status and specified collection to be exported a specified directory.  

- Improved Error Handling - Eliminated a few more instances where use of the browser's back button could lead to trouble.

- SchemaView Improvements - The schema viewer's interface has been improved, with better navigation and display of compositor information.

- Windows compatibility - distribution versions (WAR files) are now compatible with Windows as well as Unix/MaxOS

Changes in version 2.3.0

Security and Access Restrictions
- Roles and Permissions - simple Authentication and Authorization scheme
(see RolesManager)
- Guarded buttons
- see notes in swiki about design of framework

Collection-config
- FinalStatusFlag - each collection has a final status flag which can be used to filter exports and also to trigger automatic actions.
- CollectionInfo - tuples store default information that is used to populate all new records created for this collection.

WorkFlowServices - any change to a record's status is broadcast to the WorkFlowServices class. This is the basic hook for implementing workflow support. (currently the workflowstatus listener merely prints a message to the log file).

MetaData Editor
- support for combo-Input elements
- fieldInfo protocol for reading fields info
- best practices documentation gets fleshed out
- improved validation for dates

Importing and Exporting
- improved reporting. reports saved within system and can be viewed.
- validation is cached in the DcsDataRecord to save time. If the lastMod date of metdata file is different from that of cash, the validation is performed.

Changes in version 2.2.0b

Interface changes as result of 1/15/05 walkthrough and takehome
- make sure there are roll-overs for all interface elements/buttons
- group buttons to resemble grouping in search/view, and put save, validate,
exit together somehow.
- after making a choice, the new element should be expanded (it is now collapsed) 
- changed "new xxxx" to "add" for metadata editor controls
- ensure "required choice" select element defaults to "--choice--" 
- initialize top-level collapse widgets to "open" (see
itemRecord/technical/online). This was hardwired in CollapseBeanInitializer
since it goes against the collapse policy currently in effect, which is to close
all level 1 nodes and open the rest

Framework-related changes
- "en" now an (editable) default value for itemRecord/general/language
- uniqueUrl implmented for News & Opps, ADN frameworks in support of enforcing
unique Urls
- collection-config schema allows collection-specific settings (such as a set of
statusFlags). collection settings are editable via settings->collections
settings.
- dcs_data schema (for workFlow status records) now allows for status history to
be recorded and maintained.

Record Operations
- following single-record operations supported: create, new, copy, move, delete,
statusChange
- following batch (involving sets of records) operations supported: batchMove,
batchDelete, batchStatusChange

StatusHistory
- a history of status changes for each record now maintained

Concurrency Control
- session-based locking of records before all operations that can change content
of metadata or status.
- mechanism to release locked records as a safeguard (available via
"settings -> sessions")

- Status (DcsDataRecords) now retains a history of status changes. Status
history is viewable from search, view and status editing

Changes in Version 2.1.1b

- project directory cleaned up. Only metadata frameworks not available on the
web are included in the WEB-INF/metadata-frameworks directory

- both collections and frameworks are configured off .xml files (see
WEB-INF/collection-config and WEB-INF/framework-config directories). Collection
configurables include status flags.

- DDS Webservice interface files are now copied from dds-project at deploy-time
rather than existing in static form. DCS webservice interface and examples are
located in the web/services directory
