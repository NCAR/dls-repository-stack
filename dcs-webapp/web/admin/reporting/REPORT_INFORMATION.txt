Term count report information
-----------------------------

These term count reports are generated by DCS and 
may be imported into Excel via WebQuery. 

For a list of reports to generate, see:
http://dlese.org/dds/admin/reporting/index.jsp


The data in these reports are as follows:

Term: a term that appears in one or more of the given fields.

Term count: the total number of times the term appears within the 
given fields throughout all records in the index.

Record count: the total number of records in which the term
appears in one or more of the given fields.

Fields: a list of fields among the requested fields in which the 
term appears.


Note that if more than one field is requested the report takes considerably
longer to generate than if only one field is requested.
