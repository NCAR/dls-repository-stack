			This service provides access to DLESE's text-based search and additional data through a simple 
			programatic interface. The service returns metadata about educational resources, 
			collections, annotations, and other information.
			
			DLESE's mission is to improve the quality, quantity, and efficiency of teaching 
			and learning about the Earth System, by developing, managing, and providing access 
			to high-quality educational resources and supporting services through a community-based, 
			distributed digital library. Intended users include students, educators, researchers 
			and citizens of all ages, in both formal and informal learning environments. The 
			collection favors resources that convey linkages and connections; the general with the 
			specific, theory with evidence, global with local, and that demonstrate the application 
			of science to solving real world problems. This includes providing access to Earth data 
			sets and imagery, and the tools and interfaces that enable their effective use. DLESE 
			resources are community-contributed, by individuals, organizations, and formal collection 
			efforts.
