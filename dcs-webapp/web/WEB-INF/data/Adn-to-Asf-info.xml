Beginning with simple instruments, students can use rulers to measure the length, height, and depth of objects and materials; thermometers to measure temperature; watches to measure time; beam balances and spring scales to measure weight and force; magnifiers to observe objects and organisms; and microscopes to observe the finer details of plants, animals, rocks, and other materials.  Children also develop skills in the use of computers and calculators for conducting investigations.</asfText></standard><standard id="ae5826fe-517c-46a4-a76c-e393d3e4d72b"><adnText>NSES:5-8:Content Standard C Life Science Standards:Diversity and adaptations of organisms:Biological evolution accounts for the diversity of species developed through gradual processes over many generations.

This process of photosynthesis provides a vital connection between the sun and the energy needs of living systems. </asfText></standard><standard id="5cf69030-c20e-483e-90a9-43c1f49c8df1"><adnText>NSES:K-4:Content Standard G History and Nature of Science Standards:Science as a human endeavor:Many people choose science as a career and devote their entire lives to studying it.
