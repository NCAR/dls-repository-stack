Students should understand various methods of controlling the reproduction process and that each method has a different type of effectiveness and different health and social consequences.</mapping>
	<mapping asnIdentifier="http://purl.org/ASN/resources/S100F266">NSES:5-8:Content Standard G History and Nature of Science Standards:Nature of science:It is part of scientific inquiry to evaluate the results of scientific investigations, experiments, observations, theoretical models, and the explanations proposed by other scientists. Evaluation includes reviewing the experimental procedures, examining the evidence, identifying faulty reasoning, pointing out statements that go beyond the evidence, and suggesting alternative explanations for the same observations. Although scientists may disagree about explanations of phenomena, about interpretations of data, or about the value of rival theories, they do agree that questioning, response to criticism, and open communication are integral to the process of science. As scientific knowledge evolves, major disagreements are eventually resolved through such interactions between scientists.</mapping>

Students should understand the difference between scientific and other questions. They should appreciate what science and technology can reasonably contribute to society and what they cannot do. For example, new technologies often will decrease some risks and increase others.</mapping>
	<mapping asnIdentifier="http://purl.org/ASN/resources/S1018F69">NSES:K-4:Content Standard A Science as Inquiry Standards:Understanding about scientific inquiry:Simple instruments, such as magnifiers, thermometers, and rulers, provide more information than scientists obtain using only their senses.</mapping>

	<mapping asnIdentifier="http://purl.org/ASN/resources/S101D529">NSES:9-12:Content Standard A Science as Inquiry Standards:Understandings about scientific inquiry:Scientists conduct investigations for a wide variety of reasons. For example, they may wish to discover new aspects of the natural world, explain recently observed phenomena, or test the conclusions of prior investigations or the predictions of current theories.</mapping>
	<mapping asnIdentifier="http://purl.org/ASN/resources/S100A6A3">NSES:9-12:Content Standard C Life Science Standards:Matter, energy, and organization in living systems:As matter and energy flows through different levels of organization of living systems--cells, organs, organisms, communities--and between living systems and the physical environment, chemical elements are recombined in different ways. Each recombination results in storage and dissipation of energy into the environment as heat. Matter and energy are conserved in each change.</mapping>

	<mapping asnIdentifier="http://purl.org/ASN/resources/S10196D4">NSES:9-12:Content Standard A Science as Inquiry Standards:Understandings about scientific inquiry:Scientific explanations must adhere to criteria such as, a proposed explanation must be logically consistent; it must abide by the rules of evidence; it must be open to questions and possible modification; and it must be based on historical and current scientific knowledge.</mapping>
	<mapping asnIdentifier="http://purl.org/ASN/resources/S10180F9">NSES:5-8:Content Standard D Earth and Space Science Standards:Structure of the earth system:Some changes in the solid earth can be described as the 'rock cycle.' Old rocks at the earth's surface weather, forming sediments that are buried, then compacted, heated, and often recrystallized into new rock. Eventually, those new rocks may be brought to the surface by the forces that drive plate motions, and the rock cycle continues.</mapping>

	<mapping asnIdentifier="http://purl.org/ASN/resources/S100ABE0">NSES:5-8:Content Standard D Earth and Space Science Standards:Structure of the earth system:Water, which covers the majority of the earth's surface, circulates through the crust, oceans, and atmosphere in what is known as the 'water cycle.' Water evaporates from the earth's surface, rises and cools as it moves to higher elevations, condenses as rain or snow, and falls to the surface where it collects in lakes, oceans, soil, and in rocks underground.</mapping>
