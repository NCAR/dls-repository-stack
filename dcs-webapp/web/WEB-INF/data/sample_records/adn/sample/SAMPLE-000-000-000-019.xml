<title>Welcome to the Global Warming Project</title>
<description>In this project students learn about the scientific factors that contribute to the controversial global warming debate. The project places students as advisors to the heads of state of several different nations, prompting students to learn about the issue as they respond to the various questions and concerns of these leaders. As expert scientists on the issue, the class will need to understand and be able to explain to the heads of state what forces affect climate and what global warming actually means. Once they do this, they will need to help the different nations of the world understand how global warming will affect them and what they can do about it. Each team of students will be responsible for advising one country and will ultimately need to present a proposal that offers a set of solutions which address the concerns of their country. Stages of the project include an introduction to the basic issues of global warming, understanding the factors that contribute to temperature change, investigating the factors that determine global temperature and energy use, understanding potential consequences of atmospheric pollution on global climate, and finding solutions to these types of problems. Also included is an online journey through the Carbon and Water cycles.</description>
