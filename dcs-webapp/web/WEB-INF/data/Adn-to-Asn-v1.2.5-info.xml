:Abilities Necessary to Do Scientific Inquiry:Use data to construct a reasonable explanation. This aspect of the standard emphasizes the students' thinking as they use data to formulate explanations.  Even at the earliest grade levels, students should learn what constitutes evidence and judge the merits or strength of data and information that will be used to make explanations.  After students propose an explanation, they will appeal to the knowledge and evidence they obtained to support their explanations.  Students should check their explanations against scientific knowledge, experiences, and observations of others.</asnText></standard><standard id="http://purl.org/ASN/resources/S101E20E"><adnText>NSES:K-4:Content Standard D Earth and Space Science Standards:Objects in the sky</adnText><asnText>**  pattern not found **:Content Standard D:As a result of their activities in grades K-4, all students should develop an understanding of

Transmission of genetic information to offspring occurs through egg and sperm cells that contain only one representative from each chromosome pair. An egg and a sperm unite to form a new individual. The fact that the human body is formed from cells that contain two copies of each chromosome â and therefore two copies of each gene â explains many features of human heredity, such as how variations that are hidden in one generation can be expressed in the next.</asnText></standard><standard id="http://purl.org/ASN/resources/S10039B5"><adnText>NSES:9-12:Content Standard E Science and Technology Standards:Understandings about science and technology:Creativity, imagination, and a good knowledge base are all required in the work of science and engineering.</adnText><asnText>**  pattern not found **:Content Standard E:As a result of activities in grades 9-12, all students should develop
