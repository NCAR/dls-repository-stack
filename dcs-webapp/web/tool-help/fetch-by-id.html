<h3>Tool Help - Fetch by ID</h3>

<p>The ADN editor is able to fetch records from the 
 <a href="http://www.dlese.org/" target="_blank">DLESE library</a> by record ID.
 To fetch a record from DLESE, enter a valid ID in the <span class="help-em">Record ID</span>
 field and select the <span class="help-em">Fetch by ID</span> button.
 </p>

<blockquote>To try this feature out, use this ID: DLESE-000-000-004-409</blockquote>

<p>Note: Records fetched from DLESE are saved <i>locally</i> when the <span
class="help-em">write</span> button is selected.</p>


<h4>Implementation Details</h4>
The <i>Fetch by ID</i> feature uses <a href="http://swiki.dpc.ucar.edu/Project-Discovery/108">DDS web services</a>
to retrieve records.
