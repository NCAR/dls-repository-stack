<h3>Tool Help - Change Id</h3>

<p>The <span class="help-em">Record Id</span> determines the file name when the
XML record is written to disk (i.e., when the <span class="help-em">write</span>
button is selected). Use the Record Id field and the <span class="help-em">Change
Id</span> button to set or change the Record Id. </p>

<p>Note: a <span class="help-em">Record Id</span> is required before a record can be written to disk</p>
