Changes in the web service search JSP client template and examples

v3.1

- ListCollections response now properly populates the <additionalMetadata><dlese_collect> 
element in the header (previously was empty).

- Rendering guidelines elements now only disply content if the metadata vocay has values
for them, else they are empty

- When metadata vocabs are empty, the default, unencoded value is displayed in certain
responses rather than empty

- ListCollections returns the short title for the label under rendering guidelines instead of 
blank if there is no metadata vocab for it


v3.0

- Client updated to use DDSWS protocol v1.1. 
For DDSWS v1.0, use client version 2.6 or earlier.

v2.6

- Added arrow down annimation to the checkbox menus when clicked, 
and ability to click the label to select/de-select an item

- Fixed the redirect URL, which was missing the & in front of the 
ID parameter in full/collection description pages

- Added check to be sure the vocab labels Maps get loaded for
display in the search results and full description

v2.5

- Created separate CSS classes for all elements in the template
so that they can be defined separatly from other styles
used by sites that incorporate the template

- Added xalan.jar for compatibility with Tomcat 5.5

- Improved the response time performance for rendering the page.
Vocabs stored and cached in a HashMap for rapid look-up for 
display.

- Simplified the default display of search results.

- Disabled ability to search within the smart links - this behavior
was confusing for users

- Changed the page layout and display and created more usable example
menus and smart links

- Added additional documentation for developers

v2.4

- Added a JavaScript proxy configuration to the distribution 
and a static HTML page for displaying the search template.
The JavaScript proxy makes it possible to serve any page in 
this client using a static HTML page. With this technique, any
dynamic page (search, etc.) can be made available via a
static web site

- Added subjects to the brief display

- Added unique variable names for the check box menus. It is
now possible to install multiple search contexts in a single
Tomcat/JVM without possible variable name collisions with 
the menus.

- Added some additional instructions for using the template

v2.3

- Updated the links for annotations to accomodate
comments and the display of multiple annotations
for a single resource

- Template now uses UserSearch request instead of Search
because of it's simplified query language and 
automatic support for boosting

v2.2

- Updated the link for submitting reviews to the CRS 

- Added grade levels and type of resource to the brief search 
results page

v2.1

- Changed the link to submit a teaching tip to one for
submitting comments or teaching tips

- Smart link menu added that is edited and defined through an
XML configuration file. The file defines the menus and the 
search queries that are associated with each menu item 
in the menu.

v2.0

- Added links to the CRS annotation service in the JSP template for
both reading and submitting reviews and teaching tips

- Added stemming to the default query used in the JSP template
and boosting for records with matching terms in their title 
(highest boost) or description (next)

- Revamped the look-and-feel of the JSP template page a bit
