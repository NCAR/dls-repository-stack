<h1> Documentation for the DLESE 
    OAI software</h1>
<h2> Version 2.0.9 </h2>
<p>OAI v2.0.9 is part of DLESE v2.3</p>
<h2> Description </h2>
<p>The <a href="http://www.dlese.org/oai/index.jsp">DLESE OAI software</a> includes a data provider that supports the <a href="http://www.openarchives.org">Open 
    Archives Initiative</a> <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html">Protocol 
    for Metadata Harvesting</a> (OAI-PMH) v2.0 and a harvester that supports OAI-PMH 
  v2.0 and v1.1. The data provider serves metadata from XML files stored on a 
  file system. Likewise, the harvester saves downloaded metadata to XML files 
  on the local file system. In addition to standard OAI protocol support, the 
  data provider includes a search web service similar to the <a href="http://oai.dlib.vt.edu/odl/">Open 
    Digital Library</a> (ODL) search specification (odlsearch1), which supports 
  keyword and fielded searching over the metadata repository. </p>
<p>The software includes a number of feature that are designed to help support 
  the activities of collection builders. These include the ability to validate 
  individual or entire sets of metadata files in the repository, the ability to 
  search over the full text in the metadata, and to search by metadata format 
  and set. The harvester supports individual harvests or incremental harvests, 
  and provides feedback to users about the progress of the the data transfer both 
  during and after the harvest.</p>
<p>Some of the features that are supported include sets, resumptionTokens, deletions, 
  date granularity down to the second, gzip compression of data transferred over 
  the Internet, and extendable plug-and-play metadata format conversion (supports 
  XSLT or Java classes written for a specific format conversion). Reports are 
  available to users that detail any errors found in the metadata records, and 
  show the harvesting activity that has taken place in the data provider.</p>
<p>The OAI software is designed using the Model-View-Controller architecture. 
  See the <a href="oai-MVC-design.ppt">OAI architecture diagram</a> for details.</p>
<p>The <a href="javadoc">DLESE Java library Javadoc</a> is available 
  as a reference.</p>
<p></p>
<h2> Audience </h2>
<p>Collection builders and library administrators, DLESE collaborators needing an 
  out-of-the-box OAI solution. 
</p>
<h2> How this component is used </h2>
<p>For collection builders:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Add one or more sets of metadata files from a local repository to be served 
    via OAI.</li>
  <li>Search for individual records in the repository by keyword, set and/or metadata 
    format. </li>
  <li>View and validate individual records in the repository.</li>
  <li>Harvest metadata from other OAI data providers.</li>
</ul>
<h2> Functional requirements </h2>
<ul>
  <li>Support the OAI-PMH v2.0 for both data providing and harvesting.</li>
  <li>Provide and harvest metadata directly to/from files on disk.</li>
  <li>Ability to transform ADN to the nsdl_dc and oai_dc formats for data providing.</li>
  <li>Ability to serve multiple sets.</li>
  <li>Perform schema validation of records.</li>
  <li>Support deletions.</li>
  <li>Support the ability to serve very large sets using resumptionTokens.</li>
  <li>Ability to serve any schema-based metadata format.</li>
  <li>Ability to serve the DLESE-IMS DTD-based format.</li>
  <li>Distributed as an easy to install and use out-of-the-box OAI solution for 
    use by DLESE partners and others in the OAI and open source communities.</li>
</ul>
<h2> Technologies used </h2>
<p>Java, J2EE, Struts, Lucene, Tomcat, Dom4j, JSTL tag libraries. 
</p>
<h2> Development process and workflow </h2>
<p>See the <a href="software-development-process.html">development 
    process documentation</a> for details on how the software is developed and 
  deployed.</p>
<h3>Release deployment process</h3>
<p>The DLESE OAI software is made available to the DLESE, OAI and open source 
  communities as an out-of-the-box OAI solution. The DLESE OAI software is released 
  under the <a href="http://www.dlese.org/oai/LICENSE.txt">GPL open source licence.</a> 
  Individuals can download the software from the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=23991">DLESE 
    SourceForge</a> portal. Two zipped archives are made available for download: 
  one contains a binary Java WAR file that can be deployed directly into a servlet 
  container such as Tomcat for rapid deployment. The other contains a source code 
  distribution that can be built and deployed using Ant.</p>
<p>The software is deployed in three steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The binary and source distributions are built with ant using the 'dist' 
    target (see <a href="software-development-process.html">development 
      process documentation</a> for details).</li>
  <li>The source and binary distributions are uploaded to the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=23991">DLESE 
      SourceForge</a> portal.</li>
  <li>Instructions and change notes are uploaded to the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=23991">DLESE 
      SourceForge</a> portal, and updated on the metadata web page as necessary.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<h2> Testing and maintenance procedures </h2>
<p>See the <a href="software-development-process.html#testing">development 
  process documentation section on testing</a>. 
</p>
<h2> Future development anticipated </h2>
<p>There are a number of anticipated updates to be made that will improve the workflow 
  for ingesting records to the DLESE metadata repository and exporting from it. 
  These involve automating some tasks that are now manual and improving upon current 
  functionality that exists in the tool. Updates to be made may include: Sets can 
  appear as more than one set; ability to harvest multiple repositories at once; 
  ability to perform a &quot;fresh&quot; harvest by first deleting any previously 
  harvested records, then harvesting the new ones from scratch; address some usability 
  issues in the data provider administration page; ability to change the indexing 
  interval on-the-fly. </p>
