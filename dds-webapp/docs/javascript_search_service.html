<h1> Documentation for the DLESE 
    JavaScript Search Service </h1>
<h2> Version 1.1</h2>
<h2> Description </h2> 
<p>The DLESE JavaScript Search  Service is used by internal and external web developers to create custom DLESE search web pages and to display  DLESE resources dynamically in static HTML pages. To implement a client, developers need only to use HTML, JavaScript and CSS, and  clients can be deployed to any static-page web server without the need to run CGI, Tomcat or other application software. The service returns HTML as a JavaScript write( ) statement, which is inserted into the static page using a JavaScript-based service API. Using the API, developers are able to customize both  the functional and display features of their client.  Functional features include the ability to limit the search page scope to a given sub-set of resources that are defined by term or field, ability to boost results that contain given terms or fields, and the ability to define and render custom menus and smart links that are defined by terms or fields. Display features include the ability to display or omit various HTML elements  in the search page. The available elements for display include a text form for submitting a search, menus for selecting grade levels, subjects, resource types, collection or standards, and control over what is displayed in the search results. </p>
<h2> Audience </h2> 
<p> This service is meant to be used by web page developers, library developers, educational designers or others wishing to incorporate DLESE resources and search functionality into their web sites.
</p>
