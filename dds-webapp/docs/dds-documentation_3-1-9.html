<h1> Documentation for the DLESE 
    Discovery System (DDS)</h1>
<h2> Version 3.1.9 </h2>
<p>DDS v3.1.9 is part of DLESE v2.2
</p>
<h2> Description </h2> 
<p>The <a href="http://www.dlese.org/dds/index.jsp">DLESE Discovery System</a> (DDS) provides search and discovery services for items in the library including educational resources, resource annotations, news and opportunity postings, collection metadata, and other metadata types. These discovery services are available in two ways: First through the main library interface at <a href="http://www.dlese.org/">www.dlese.org</a>, which is accessed by library visitors who perform searches using their web browser. Second, through DLESE's <a href="search_web_services_1-0.html">search web service</a>, which provides programmatic access to DLESE's metadata and search functionality for distributed access by developers. The DDS is designed to support  rapid search and retrieval for items in the library using natural language, boolean, vocabulary field, date range and geospatial bounding box queries. The system uses an inverse index and Information Retrieval techniques implemented using  <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/">Lucene</a>. The DDS also includes a set of administrative functions to aid in managing and monitoring the collections through a web interface accessible to library administrators. </p>
<p>The DDS software is built upon a <a href="http://java.sun.com/blueprints/guidelines/designing_enterprise_applications_2e/web-tier/web-tier5.html">Model-View-Controller</a> 
  (MVC) architecture that is implemented using the <a href="http://struts.apache.org/">Struts 
    application framework</a>. In this MVC architecture, the major parts of 
  the software are broken up into three separate components: First, the Model component contains and exposes the metadata repository and accompanying information model; Second, the View  provides the data presentation to the user's web browser and the search web service; Third, the Controller component dispatches requests and controls flow between the Model and the View components (see [1]). The specific Java classes that are 
  associated with these components are outlined in the DDS 
  MVC class diagram below.</p>

<h3>Indexing and searching algorithms</h3>
<p>To provide rapid search and retrieval over the DLESE  repository, 
  an inverse index of each of the items in the library is created and maintained, which is constructed from the metadata and the content found in the educational resources in the library. The index is rebuilt once a day to incorporate additions, modifications or deletions to the library. The Java class <a href="javadoc/org/dlese/dpc/index/FileIndexingService.html">FileIndexingService</a> 
  is used to manage the indexing process and in general there is a <a href="javadoc/org/dlese/dpc/index/writer/package-summary.html">DocWriter</a> class responsible for indexing each of the metadata frameworks available in the library.</p>
<p>During index creation time, a <a href="javadoc/org/dlese/dpc/repository/RecordDataService.html">RecordDataService</a> 
  is used to access information from the <a href="idmapper_1-2.html">ID Mapper</a> 
  about duplicate records across collections that refer to the same resource and to get the content from the resources for indexing. 
  The <a href="javadoc/org/dlese/dpc/repository/RecordDataService.html">RecordDataService</a> 
  also retrieves information from the index about annotations. Information about 
  duplicate records and annotations is then used by the <a href="javadoc/org/dlese/dpc/index/writer/ADNFileIndexingWriter.html">ADNFileIndexingWriter</a> 
  and incorporated into the individual item-level index entries for each record. 
  This information is used at search time to boost the ranking of items that contain 
  annotations and to provide the user with a single result for each resource that 
  has multiple record entries in the repository. </p>
<h4>Removing duplicate entries for resources in search results</h4>
<p>DLESE contains multiple collections of educational resources contributed by a variety of partners. Because these collections are developed and maintained independently, there are a number of resources that are cataloged multiple times. One of the goals of the DDS is to provide users with a single search result 
  for each resource that exists in the library even when there are multiple records 
  across collections that refer to the resource. For example, the resource &quot;Earth 
  Science Picture of the Day&quot; is cataloged twice in DLESE - once by the NASA 
  ESE Reviewed Collection and again by the DLESE Community Collection (DCC). Rather 
  than returning  two results to users at search time, the DDS presents 
  the user with the single result that best matches their search criteria. In 
  this example, the <a href="http://www.dlese.org/dds/query.do?q=%22Earth%20Science%20Picture%20of%20the%20Day%22&s=0&setVocabState=re&setVocabState=gr&setVocabState=ky&setVocabState=cs&setVocabState=su&gr=&re=&cs=&ky=&su=">DDS 
    search for the phrase &quot;Earth Science Picture of the Day&quot;</a> returns 
  a single result that displays the metadata cataloged by the NASA ESE Reviewed 
  Collection, and a link is provided that provides access to the other collection's 
  metadata, in this case the DLESE Community Collection (DCC).</p>
<p>To implement this single result per resource searching behavior, special techniques 
  are used both at index creation time and at search time. At index creation time, 
  two separate Lucene indexes are created: a primary index and a secondary index. 
  The primary index is constructed with two kinds of entries: single-item entries 
  that contain the text/field data from a single metadata record, which occurs 
  when the record is the only one in the repository that refers to a given resource, 
  and multi-item entries that contain the commingled text/field data from a group 
  of metadata records, which occurs when there are multiple records across collections 
  that refer to the same resource. The indexed content for the title field in 
  a single-item entry, for example, will consist of the text from a single metadata 
  record whereas the indexed content in the title field for a multi-record entry 
  will contain the title field text from multiple metadata records concatenated 
  together. Fields such as the title, description, URL, subject, grade level and 
  resource type are stored in the index to allow rapid retrieval for display at 
  search time. Single-item entries contain data that is ready for display, however 
  because multi-item entries contain concatenated data from multiple records in 
  these fields, they can not be used for display purposes. </p>
<p>When the indexing process is complete, each record in the repository has been 
  accounted for in the primary index, some as single-item entries and some as 
  members of multi-item entries. As the primary index is being constructed, the 
  secondary index is also being generated. The secondary index is constructed 
  by inserting single-item entries for each of the individual records that are 
  members of multi-item entries in the primary index. These single-item entries 
  are identical to the single-item entries in the primary index. This is important 
  because it allows them to be searched in the same way and used interchangeably 
  along with the single-item entries in the primary index to facilitate the display 
  of results at search time.</p>
<p>At search time, the primary and secondary indexes are accessed in two stages 
  to produce the results that get selected and displayed to the user. In stage 
  one, the primary index is searched using the user's search criteria to form 
  an ordered list of matching results. This list contains a mixture of single-item 
  and multi-item entries. As noted earlier, only single-item entries can be displayed 
  in results in the UI, so the multi-item entries in the initial results list 
  must be replace with single-item entries prior to displaying them to users. 
  In the second stage, then, the secondary index is searched each time a multi-item 
  entry is encountered, and the best-matching single-item entry is selected from 
  among the resources that comprise the multi-item record. This single-item entry 
  is used in the display to the user, and links are provided in the UI that allow 
  access to the other records that make up the multi-item entry. </p>
<p>In this second search stage, up to three searches may be necessary in order 
  to arrive at a best-matching result from among the records that make up a multi-item 
  entry. As a first try, the user's original search criteria are applied to the 
  individual single-item records located in the secondary index that comprise 
  the multi-item entry. In many cases this search will produce one or more results. 
  If results are present, the best-matching one is returned for display to the 
  user. It is possible, however, that no results will be encountered. This may 
  occur if the user's search criteria does not match the content of any one single-item 
  entry. For example, consider two records that make up a multi-item entry: record 
  A contains the searchable text &quot;ocean&quot; but does not contain the grade 
  range 9-12; record B contains the grade range 9-12 but does not contain the 
  text &quot;ocean.&quot; The user types the search &quot;ocean&quot; while selecting 
  grades 9-12. In this case, the multi-item entry corresponding to records A and 
  B contains both the text &quot;ocean&quot; and grade range 9-12 and thus it 
  appears in the list of results generated in stage one. In stage two the same 
  search criteria are applied to the single-item entries for records A and B. 
  Since neither A or B contain both the text &quot;ocean&quot; and grade range 
  9-12, no matching results are found. When this occurs, additional searches using 
  less precise search criteria are required in order to select a best-match. As 
  a second pass, precision is reduced by giving precedence to the keyword portion 
  of the user's query and removing any non-text-based search criteria. In the 
  current example this would mean a search for &quot;ocean&quot; without grade 
  range 9-12. Based on this refined search criteria, record A would appear as 
  a matching result and would thus be returned for display to the user. Even with 
  this more lenient criteria, however, it is still possible that no matches will 
  be found. This can occur if the user did not use any keywords in their search 
  or if the user entered multiple terms as part of their search, some of which 
  being part of record A and the others part of record B. At this point, the third 
  and final search case must produce a result since it is the last search to be 
  performed. To ensure a result, then, one of either record A or B is chosen at 
  random and used in the results display.</p>
