  
=== Build instructions for the Digital Discovery System (DDS) ===

These instructions describe how to generate a WAR file for the
software or deploy directly to Tomcat from source.
See INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS.txt for information about installing a pre-built WAR file.

Access the DDS software code repository on GitHub:
https://github.com/NCAR/dls-repository-stack/

These instructions assume familiarity with the Apache Ant build tool,
Java, CVS, and Tomcat.

The following are required to build and run the software from source:
-Java 8 or above
-Ant build tool (http://ant.apache.org/)
-A Git client of your choice

Optional:
-Tomcat version 6.x or 7.x (http://tomcat.apache.org/) (needed to deploy directly to Tomcat)


Build instructions:

1. Obtain the required source code modules from GitHub:

	* dds-webapp - The DDS webapp context files, libraries and JSPs


2. Obtain and install Ant, Java, and optionally Tomcat (see above).

3. Place the required source code directories into
a single directory where you will be building the software.

4. Build or deploy the software

  --- Option 1: Generate a WAR file ---
* Change directory into dls-repository-stack/dds-webapp/

* Execute the Ant 'war' target. You should see a number of messages 
in your terminal. Once complete you should see a message like:
    [echo] WAR file was created configured for data source 'fileSystem'
	BUILD SUCCESSFUL
    Total time: 1 minute 22 seconds
    
* If error messages appear, address the issues described and re-try 
until successful.
    
* The generated WAR file will have been saved to dds-webapp/war-distribution/dds.war

* Place the WAR file into the webapps directory of your Tomcat instance and start/restart
to launch the application in the container.


  --- Option 2: Deploy directly to a local Tomcat ---

* Create a file named build.properties in your home directory
(alternatively this may be placed in the dds-webapp directory).

* Edit the build.properties file to include the Ant properties that
are required for the build. These are listed at the top of the build.xml 
file at the root level of the dds-webapp.

* Execute the Ant 'deploy' target. You should see a number of messages 
in your terminal. Once complete you should see a message like:
    BUILD SUCCESSFUL
    Total time: 56 seconds
	
* If error messages appear, address the issues described and re-deploy
until successful.

* The software will be built into a directory named "dds" inside your
Tomcat webapps directory in the same manner as if it had been deployed
from a WAR file.

* Start/restart your tomcat instance to launch the application in the container


-- Additional notes ---

* See the build.xml file inside the dds-webapp for additional
Ant targets that may be of interest.

* Follow the additional instructions for starting/stopping Tomcat and configuring DDS 
that are described in INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS.txt and CONFIGURE_DATA_SOURCES.txt
