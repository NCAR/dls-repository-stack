=== Installation instructions for the Digital Discovery System (DDS) ===

DDS runs in a Tomcat servlet container and can be installed on 
Windows, Linux, Mac OS or UNIX systems. 

These instructions assume familiarity with Java Servlets, Java Server Pages (JSP), 
the Tomcat servlet container and related technologies.


To install DDS from a WAR file, do the following:
  
1. Obtain the dds.war file from the distribution.

2. Install Java 6 or above and Tomcat 6.x or 7.x

3. Place the dds.war file in the ${tomcat}/webapps directory.

4. Edit the file ${tomcat}/conf/tomcat-users.xml in your Tomcat installation and
add the role 'dds_admin' and at least one user assigned to that role. This
restricts access to the Collection Manager and other admin pages in DDS.
		
	For example:
	
	<tomcat-users>
		<role rolename="dds_admin"/>
		... additional roles not shown ...
		
		<user username="jdoe" password="mypassword" roles="dds_admin"/>
		... additional users not shown...
	</tomcat-users>
	
5. Start/restart Tomcat to unpack the war files and install the DDS Web application.

6. See the deployment descriptor file ${tomcat}/webapps/dds/WEB-INF/web.xml for additional,
optional configuration options. Note that for a long-term operational deployment,
the context parameters 'indexLocation', 'collBaseDir' and 'repositoryData' should be
configured to point to local file directories OUTSIDE of tomcat.
These directories should be backed at regular intervals if repository 
data preservation is desired. A DDS repository may be restored using
a backup copy of these directories.

7. To configure the data source used for DDS, read the instructions provided in the DDS 
Web interface or the file CONFIGURE_DATA_SOURCES.txt.
