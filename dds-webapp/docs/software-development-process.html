<h1> Software development process for DLS components </h1>
<h2>Description </h2>
<p>The software development process used at Digital Learning Sciences (DLS) is designed to enable 
  concurrent  incremental development of components by multiple 
  software engineers, web designers and others in a distributed fashion. The process 
  is used in the development of  major 
  software components including the <a href="http://www.dlese.org/dds/services/dds_software.jsp">Digital Discovery System</a> (DDS), 
  the <a href="http://www.dlese.org/dds/services/dcs_software.jsp">Digital Collection System</a> (DCS) (also packaged as the <a href="http://wiki.nsdl.org/index.php/Community:NCS">NSDL Collection System</a> (NCS)),
  and the <a href="http://www.dlese.org/dds/services/joai_software.jsp">jOAI software</a>. </p>
<h3>Overview of the development process</h3>
<p>The software development 
    process diagram below shows the flow of development for a typical software component. </p>
<p><img src="development-process-diagram.png" width="809" height="601"></p>
<p>The numbered items in the diagram 
    indicate the progression of development over time, which is detailed here:</p>
<p>1. The developer checks out or updates his or her code and files from the main 
  CVS repository (see the <a href="#cvs">CVS repository description</a> below). 
  Each time the developer performs an update, he or she will receive changes made 
  by other developers working on the project and obtain the latest version of 
  the software under development. Alternatively, developers may request older 
  versions of the code and files to work on, if necessary.</p>
<p>2. Once the developer has updated their working copy of the code and files, 
  he or she performs an Ant build to compile the software and deploy it to their 
  personal application server (Tomcat) (see the <a href="#build">software build 
    description</a> below). The developer can then accesses their server to inspect 
  the changes that others have committed. The developer will then make changes 
  to their working copy to add or change functionality, which typically involves 
  making changes, deploying them to the application server, inspecting, testing 
  and verifying them multiple times in an iterative fashion. While working in 
  their development area, the changes that they make are not available to other 
  developers until they are committed to CVS.</p>
<p>3. The developer then commits the changes he or she has made to the global 
  CVS repository, and enters notes about those changes that other developers can 
  read. Typically commits are made once the developer has verified that the changes 
  they have made will not break the software or disrupt the work of other developers. 
  When changes are committed, other developers are notified automatically by e-mail 
  and they may then update their working copy to obtain the changes when they 
  are ready. </p>
<p>4. At major and minor release points, a web administrator will check out the 
  code and files to perform a master build. Major release points occur infrequently 
  and involve major changes in the software. Minor release points occur more frequently, 
  on the order of once or twice a month, and involve small changes in the UI and/or 
  small bug fixes.</p>
<p>5. The web admin builds the updated software to an integration server for testing. 
  The integration server closely mirrors the live environment by bringing together 
  multiple components of the library that interact with the software. Once built, 
  the staff performs a series of tests to verify the software (see the <a href="#testing">testing 
    procedures description</a> below). Bugs that are detected are sent back to 
  developers for fixes. Fixes then get re-updated to the integration server and 
  re tested until found satisfactory.</p>
<p>6. Once the software has completed testing, the web administrator performs 
  a build to the live web application server. During this build process, traffic 
  is re-directed through the integration server so that users will see no down 
  time. Once the build is complete, traffic is once again directed to the live 
  server. Finally, an administrator tags the code and files in CVS with a version 
  number for future retrieval by version, if necessary (see the <a href="#versioning">software 
    versioning description</a> below).</p>
<h3><a name="structure"></a>Software project structure</h3>
<p>The typical software project contains all the files and libraries necessary 
  to build the software within a single directory. Each project resides in a 
   CVS or Subversion code repository. As a rule, each project directory is named xxx-project, where xxx 
  denotes the software or module name, for example DDS, jOAI, etc. In many 
  cases a project will have dependencies upon other projects at build time and/or 
  run time. For example the DDS, DCS, jOAI and ID mapper projects depend on the  
  Java source code project (dlese-tools-project) at build time and the DDS uses 
  the ID mapper service, the vocabulary manager service and the shared UI components 
  at run time. Details on projects and project dependencies is provided below. 
</p>
<p>The web application projects (DDS, DCS, jOAI and others) have the following file and directory 
  structure:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <strong>build_lib</strong> (directory) - contains Java libraries necessary to build but 
    not run the software.</li>
  <li><strong>docs</strong> (directory) - contains software documentation, licenses and other information 
    that are included with the software.</li>
  <li><strong>junit_src</strong> (directory) - contains JUnit Java code written by  the developer
    that is used to perform regression testing on the software.</li>
  <li><strong>src</strong> (directory) - for web applications, this contains the application resource 
    bundles (Java properties files); for the dlese-tools-project, this contains 
    the Java source code.</li>
  <li><strong>web</strong> (directory) - web applications only - contains web pages (JSP and HTML), 
    images, css and javascript. 
    <ul>
      <li>WEB-INF (directory) - contains the application deployment descriptors 
        (web.xml used by Tomcat, struts-config.xml used by the Struts application 
        framework) and other configuration directories and files. 
        <ul>
          <li>lib (directory) - contains the Java libraries that are needed to 
            run this application</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>docs (directory) - contains software documentation that is deployed 
        in the web application.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>.cvsignore</strong> (file) - defines files and directories in the local work area 
    that will not be included in the CVS repository. These include the build.properties 
    file, which contains developer-specific properties used to build the software, 
    the build directory, which serves as a temporary staging area used during 
    the build process and the dist directory, which serves as a placeholder for 
    the software build.</li>
  <li><strong>build.xml</strong> (file) - the file used by Ant to define and control the build 
    process. See below for details on the build targets that are typically found 
    in this file.</li>
</ul>
<p>The structure above was taken directly from the jOAI project, which represents 
  a typical web application. Other projects that are not web applications have 
  similar structures. For example, the dlese-tools-project, which contains the 
  DLESE/DLS Java class libraries, lacks a web directory but instead has a scripts 
  directory that contains scripts that are used to execute Java code at the command 
  line, such as the validate and transform commands.<br>
</p>
<h3><a name="cvs"></a>The DLS CVS repository</h3>
<p>The DLS CVS repository 
  houses many of the software projects developed by DLS. Each project is contained in 
  a top-level directory within the repository. Here is a summary of some of the projects 
  currently in the repository (see the current <a href="http://dlsciences.cvs.sourceforge.net/dlsciences/">CVS 
    view</a> of the repository):</p>
<ul>
  <li> <strong>CVSROOT</strong> - the CVS administrative root project contains scripts and setting 
    used to control the behavior of the CVS repository. For example, the file 
    cvswrappers contains definitions of files that should be treated as binary 
    rather than text by CVS; the file loginfo defines how e-mail notifications 
    are sent when files are committed to the repository. See the SourceForge 
      CVS documentation for information on how this is used.</li>
  <li><strong>adn-project</strong> - a project to manage ADN metadata framework development.</li>
  <li><strong>annotation-project</strong> - a project to manage the DLESE annotation metadata framework 
    development.</li>
  <li><strong>collection-project</strong> - a project to manage the DLESE collection-level metadata 
    framework development.</li>
  <li><strong>cas-project</strong> - The Creator Acknowledgement System, used to notify resource creators that their resource has been included in the library. </li>
  <li><strong>cvs-demo-project</strong> - a demonstration project that can be used to practice using 
    CVS commands. Also contains a CVS tutorial for new developers.</li>
  <li><strong>dcs-project</strong> - the Digital Collection System (DCS) web application project. Also known as the NSDL Collection System (NCS) or SchemeEdit, this
    tool allows users to edit and manage collections of XML documents based on any XML schema.</li>
  <li><strong>dds-project</strong> - the <a href="dds-documentation.html">Digital Discovery System</a> web application project. 
  	DDS is a Java-based open source XML repository, search and discovery system that is built with Lucene. 
	Its repository is accessed through Web service APIs that may be used for a wide variety of applications.</li>
  <li><strong>dds-webclient-project</strong> - contains a variety of custom search interfaces built using the DDSWS search web service.</li>
  <li><strong>dlese-tools-project</strong> - the DLESE/DLS Java class source code project. This project contans Java code shared across many projects (DDS, DCS, jOAI, others)</li>
  <li><strong>idmap-project</strong> - the ID mapper service.</li>
  <li><strong>news-opps-project</strong> - a web application that enables library visitors to view, search and post news and opportunities for the DLESE library </li>
  <li><strong>joai-project</strong> - the jOAI software, which is used to provide and harvest 
    metadata using the OAI Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH).</li>
  <li><strong>objects-project</strong> - a project to manage the objects (tuple) metadata framwork development. </li>
  <li><strong>odl-webclient-project</strong> - contains a variety of custom search interfaces built using the DLESE ODL search web service.</li>
  <li><strong>dlese-shared-project</strong> - Shared DLESE javascript, images, CSS.</li>
  <li><strong>dlese-suggester-project</strong> - a simple web application that allows users the ability 
    to suggest a URL to a resource to be included in the DLESE library.</li>
  <li><strong>metadata-ui-project</strong> - manages XML file used to track metadata framework 
    controlled vocabularies (terms and definitions) and controls the labels of 
    the vocabularies in different DLS systems (DDS) and user interfaces (front 
    page, drop-down menus, full display).</li>
   <li><strong>sms-server-project</strong> - the Strand Maps server implements the interactive Strand Maps interface, which is provided
    through the CSIP REST protocol and a JavaScript API.</li>
</ul>
<p>A CVS tutorial is available for developers to use as a starting point or 
  as a reference. The tutorial walks through a typical use scenario that exercises 
  each of the regularly used CVS commands. In addition, the CVS repository contains 
  a demonstration project (cvs-demo-project) that can be used to practice issuing 
  CVS commands in a safe environment. The demonstration project is discussed in 
  the CVS tutorial.<br>
</p>
<h3><a name="build"></a>Software build process</h3>
<p>Many of the software projects require a build step to compile and package the 
  software for testing, deployment and/or release. The DDS, DCS and jOAI projects provide 
  an example of how a typical web application build process works. Each of these 
  projects use the <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a> utility to organize 
  and execute the software build, which is defined by the Ant build.xml file. Because the build process is fully defined in this file, each developer can build the software uniformly using the Ant utility in their development area, which may be run on any of the major platforms (Linux, UNIX, Mac OS, and Windows). </p>
<p>During a build, the Java code is compiled and 
    each of the files used in the software are copied from the project area to the 
    appropriate location expected by the web application server (<a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/">Tomcat</a>). 
    For distributable releases, this structure is then packaged as a Java WAR file, 
    which can be downloaded and dropped into a servlet container such as Tomcat for deployment. The <a href="#structure">project directory structure</a> outlined 
    above complements the build process - in some cases an entire directory, such 
    as the web directory, is copied verbatim during a build. The build process and 
    directory structure used at DLS  is similar to the deployment 
      process developed by Apache.</p>
<p>Each project build file contains instructions at the top that outline 
  what dependencies the project has and defines properties that must be set in 
  order to build the software. Within the build file there are multiple &quot;targets.&quot; 
  Each target performs a certain build function, which are defined below. Ant 
  acts a lot like the Make utility, and many of the target names stem from traditional 
  Make conventions such as &quot;clean,&quot; &quot;all,&quot; and &quot;compile.&quot; 
  Like Make, Ant only compiles and copies files when it detects the original source 
  has been modified, and otherwise leaves them alone.</p>
<p>Typical Ant targets and their function (taken from the jOAI project):</p>

</p>
<h3><a name="versioning"></a>Software versioning scheme </h3>
<p>At major release points, each software project gets a version, which is tagged 
  in CVS for retrieval. The version scheme for software applications follow this 
  convention:</p>
<p>W.X.Y</p>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>W - denotes a major revision of the software. Major revisions represent 
    large changes in functionality and/or major architectural modifications.</li>
  <li>X - denotes a significant addition of features or functionality to an existing 
    architecture and design.</li>
  <li>Y - denotes a minor bug fix or minor change in the software.</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples: DDS v3.1.9, jOAI v2.0.9</p>
<h2>Audience </h2>
<p>The development process is used by software developers both internal and external. 
</p>
<h2> How this process is used </h2>
<p>The development process is used to organize and streamline the development of 
  web applications and other software within the distributed DLS developer community. 
</p>
<h2> Technologies used </h2>
<p>Required: Ant, CVS.<br>
  Typical: Tomcat, Java, JEdit, JUnit.<br>
</p>
<h2> <a name="testing"></a>Testing and maintenance procedures </h2>
<p>In a typical software development workflow, testing occurs at two stages: locally 
  by the software developer during iterative development, and globally at major 
  release points by developers, staff and larger  community. </p>
<h3>Testing performed by developers</h3>
<p>Typically each developer will test the areas of the software that they have 
  been developing and, once they are free of noticeable bugs, will commit the 
  changes to the CVS repository. Thus, once the software is checked in to CVS 
  the developer has assured the software will compile and run and that the changes 
  will allow the continuation of development work being done by others.</p>
<p>To facilitate testing, each major Java software project has a <a href="http://www.junit.org/index.htm">JUnit</a> 
  test suite that can be extended to provide uniform regression tests for critical 
  software functionality and required software output. This is important because 
  the DLESE/DLS Java libraries are used by multiple projects. If a developer changes 
  the functionality of a Java library while working on one project the changes 
  may effect the run-time accuracy and/or performance of another project. Regression 
  testing can detect when such changes effect critical functionality across projects, 
  minimizing the need for manual testing and reducing the occurrence of unintended 
  bugs in production code. The JUnit test environment works particularly well 
  for iterative development procedures like those used at DLS. Currently regression 
  testing is not being used systematically at DLS.</p>
<h3>Performance and accuracy testing performed prior to release</h3>
<p>In addition to the regression testing that is performed by developers, additional 
  testing is performed by  staff and others in the  community prior to 
  major releases to ensure the performance and accuracy of the software meets 
  requirements. Performance testing is used to determine the number of user requests 
  the software is able to handle in a given amount of time.  DLS uses <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/jmeter/">JMeter</a> 
  to perform this type of testing, and has also investigated the use of <a href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/David_Mosberger/httperf.html">HTTPerf</a> 
  and the <a href="http://httpunit.sourceforge.net/">HTTPUnit</a> plug in to JUnit 
  to support this form of testing in an automated, iterative fashion.</p>
<p>In addition to performance testing,  staff  performs systematic testing to determine the accuracy of the application's 
  output. This involves forming a list of requirements, creating a suite of tasks 
  that exercise the requirements and then performing the tasks and verifying the 
  output to establish reasonable accuracy. When problems are encountered, feedback 
  is passed to developers to address and then testing is performed again in an 
  iterative fashion. </p>
