<a href="#" class="close">Close</a>

<p>Repository analytics is a GUI representation of what is currently being served by the index 
throughout history. The line graph shows how many records contained a particular facet value  
for each month that is within the date range selected. All Januaries are expressed by the year instead of month
name. By default the graph shows a cumulative Collection record count, meaning its a graph of total
records counts for all collections. What data field is graphed and other useful options that can alter the graph can be found by 
clicking on the options button above the line graph. These options are described in detail below.
</p>
<h2>Options</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
	     <label>Dates:</label> Date ranges that you want included in the graph. Default start date is the earliest date 
	     a snapshot of the data was taken. Through date is the last month that a snapshot was taken. If the range is extended either way, 0's will be shown
	     for those months. Current month's data is updated once daily until the last day of the month. From then on the data for that month
	     never changes.
	</li>
	<li>
	     <label>Data Type:</label> The type of data that you want the graph to show. Selecting a different data type will change the options that
	        can be selected. This list includes all facets and their values that have ever been indexed
	</li>
	<li>
	     <label>Cumulative:</label> Whether or not to tally all selected option counts as a total value being represented by one graph line or
	          to keep each selection option as a separate line in the graph. If Cumulative is set to True the line shown is represented by the text
	          "All" in the legend and in the hover over box for each data point. 
	</li>
	<li>
	     <label>Collections:</label> Which collections to include the data from. This list will show all collections that have been in the system since
	           data snapshots were turned on, even if the collection no longer exist going forward. Note this filter option is not available
	           when the data type is Collection since in that case collections are the options. Due to browser restraints for URL length there is a max amount of
	           collections you can individually select and if too many are selected the browser will throw an error.
	</li>
	<li>
		<label>Options:</label> Which values of the data type do you want graphed and or totaled. 
		This list depends on which data type is selected. All means all values
		   that have ever been found in the repository since snapshots started. 
	</li>
	<li>
		<label>Line Labels:</label> Turns on and off the option name labels that appear after the last data element for each graphed line. These labels may or may
		    not cause a horizontal scroll bar to appear depending on the max option value length. These are extremely useful when exporting the graph to a downloadable
		    file.
	</li>
	<li>
		<label>Download:</label> Links for exporting the graph to an external file for downloading. These images will match the graph shown in the page including legends. Since
		  hover overs are not present when exporting, sometimes its useful to include line labels when exporting to downloadable file.
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Legends</h2>
<p>The Option legend will show for all graphs. If cumulative is set to True the text "All"
  is shown next to the the matching colored circle. Otherwise there will be a row for each selected option next to its
  corresponding color on the graph. For cumulative graphs if options are individually selected a list will be shown of what
  is contained within all.
  <br/><br/>
  The Collection legend will show up for all data types except for Collection since collections are the options in that case.
  This legend shows the text "All" if All collections is selected, and a list of all selected collections if collections are individually selected.
</p>  

<h2>Interactive Features</h2>
<p>
Hovering over a data point will cause a help text box to appear in the center of graph showing the data type value it belongs to, record count and month it occurred.
<br/>
Hovering over any option text or color circle in the Options legend will cause the entire graph line for that option to be
twice as thick to be distinguishable from the rest of the lines. This can be very useful when option graph lines lay on top of each other.
</p>

<h2>Special Notes</h2>
<p>
The Record Count axis automatically re-scales depending on what the range of the data points is. Therefore 
graphing two things that don't share a similar record count range will result in a graph that isn't very
useful.
