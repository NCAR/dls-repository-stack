<!-- 
	This example file is used to configure how to normalize NSDL DC records in a DDS repository, and 
	to generate reports in DDS of vocabularies that need normalization.
	
	This file defines which vocab groups files to use in normalization of NSDL metadata for the NSDL Search API, 
	which is performed by class NFRIndexer, and in the vocab reports in the DDS admin reporting area.
	
	This file should be pointed to by NFRIndexer_conf.xml, and in the DDS context-parameter 'nsdlDcVocabsConfig'
	
	The elements are as follows:
	
	<url> - Url to the groups file that defines the acceptable vocabs for this field
	<toXpath> - The XPath to the field that will have the normalzed vocabs inserted
	<fromXpaths> - The XPath to one or more fields from which existing vocabs will be mapped according to the vocabs files
	<keepExistingValues> - (optional) Set to true to keep existing values that are found. Set to false
				to keep only those vocab values that are devined in the given vocab file. Default is false
	<field> - The DDS search field from which values are derived
	
	For search field specifier <field>:
		/text//xxx - Indicates to treat the vocab string as text. Items will be counted if all terms in the vocab are present as a phrase (in the same order) 
				in one or more of the given fields for that record. Capitalization is ignored.
		/key//xxx - Indicates to treat the vocab string as a single token. Items will be counted only if they match exactly, 
				including spaces, capitalization, and other characters, in one or more of the given fields for that record.
