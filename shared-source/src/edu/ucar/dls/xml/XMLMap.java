/**
 * Provides a hashmap-like interface into an XML-based metadata file,
 * hashed by user-defined named keys. The XMLMap stores objects, often
 * strings, which map to a user-defined label. The current version 
 * requires that the mapping be created using a mapping class that has
 * been defined and made available as part of the 
 * <tt>edu.ucar.dls.xml.maps</tt> package, and instantiable via the
 * <tt>XMLMapFactory</tt> class in this package. A future release will
 * utilize XML-based configuration files instead.
 * <p>
 * Although not strictly required, each implementing class should
 * utilize the <tt>init</tt> method for intialization and subsequently
 * call the <tt>destroy</tt> method in order to release resources.
