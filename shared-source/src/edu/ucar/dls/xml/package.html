<p>Contains Interfaces and APIs for working with XML including XML 
parsing, validation and transformations.</p>

<h3>From Dave Deniman:</h3>
<p><i>Note: The following information from Dave Deniman pertains to a subset of classes 
  currently found in this package. These classes are no longer being used.</i></p>
<p>Provides a simple API for reading XML files and directories. The elements and 
  attributes of the XML file are hashed as needed to produce an easy mapping between 
  user-defined names and the desired value or object. This first release requires 
  a mapping class be constructed to implement the <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">XMLMap</font> 
  interface. The mapping is relatively easy to produce and once created makes 
  accessing values trivial. Any number of mappings can be provided. Work is in 
  progress to abstract the mapping using an XML metadata-definition file, which 
  will eliminate the need to manually create mapping classes.</p>
<p>Two classes, <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">XMLNode</font> 
  and <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">XMLRecord</font>, are 
  used to abstract the actual XML parsing. JDOM is the parser used for this implementation. 
  It would not be hard however to implement these two classes as interfaces and 
  thus allow other parsers to be utilized.</p>
<p>Two interactive test programs are provided, <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">TestMapper</font> 
  and <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">TestDirectory</font>, 
  as demos. These prompt for the XML file or directory to map and the type of 
  mapping to use. Three mappings are provided: DLESE IMS, DLESE Review Status, 
  and unqualified Dublin Core. Custom mappers can be easily added, but the appropriate 
  allocation will need to be added to <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">XMLMapFactory</font>. 
  (Running <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">TestDirectory</font> 
  on a large directory can take several minutes.)</p>
<p>See <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">XMLNode</font> for 
  a description of how the actual mappings are implemented. The &quot;key&quot; 
  structure needs to be understood when creating a mapping class. The next release 
  will abstract this using the aforementioned metadata-defintion file.</p>
<p>This is an early release. A subsequent release will provide XML editing support 
  as well.</p>

<p>
Provides the classes to abstract XML parsing and to implement the name:value mapping 
between user-defined names and actual XML. 

<p>
Implementations generally utilize metadata for defining information in user-relevant 
terminology. These metadata "objects" can and do consist of XML elements and their 
attributes, singularly or in combination with other elements/attributes.

<p>
The mapping interface provided by this package takes advantage of a hashmap implementation
that provides "keys" to individual elements of an XML DOM. See {@link edu.ucar.dls.xml.XMLNode} method
