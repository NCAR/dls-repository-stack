/**
 *  This Interface provides a mechanism for adding custom fields to Lucene index Documents that are being
 *  created for a given file. Fields created using this Interface should use a unigue field name namespace
 *  prefix to avoid field name conflicts. For information about adding fields, see the Lucene {@link
 *  org.apache.lucene.document.Document} javadoc.<p>
 *
 *  To configure one or more Lucene Analyzers to use on a per-field basis for your plugins, provide a
 *  properties file within your application's class path named 'FileIndexingPluginLuceneAnalyzers.properties'
 *  (used in the DDS, NCS, and DCS Web applications). See {@link edu.ucar.dls.index.analysis.PerFieldAnalyzer}
 *  for details. <p>
 *
 *  Example usage:<p>
 *
 *  <code>
 *private static final String FIELD_NS = "MyMetaMetadata";<br>
 *  <br>
 *  public void addFields(File file, Document newDoc, Document existingDoc)<br>
 *  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;throws Exception{ <br>
 *  <blockquote> ... code to set up data as needed ... <br>
 *  String recordStatus = myData.getRecordStatus(); <br>
 *  newDoc.add(new Field(FIELD_NS + "recordStatus", recordStatus, Field.Store.YES, Field.Index.NOT_ANALYZED));
 *  <br>
 *  ... add additional fields as needed ... <br>
 *  </blockquote> }<br>
