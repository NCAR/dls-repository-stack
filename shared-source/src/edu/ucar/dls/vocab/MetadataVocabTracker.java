 *  Interface for creation of controlled vocabulary system Ids, tracking changes

 *
 *
 *  <ol>
 *    <li> Error checking, encoded Id assignment, and UI label change tracking
 *    are OPTIONAL, as reflected in the isUsingDatabase() method</li>
 *    <li> Once an encoded Id has been assigned, it may never be re-used, but
 *    can only be retired when/if its vocab value is removed</li>
 *    <li> Only vocab VALUE encoded Ids are automatically assigned. FIELD Ids
 *    must be assigned manually, so a tracker will assume that they already
 *    exist.</li>
