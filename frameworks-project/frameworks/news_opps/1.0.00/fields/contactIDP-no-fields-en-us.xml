				<note>The intent of this field is to use a number or code to refer to a person without having to enter person information. The ability to accomplish this task is still under development and therefore this field should not be used unless it is being used for local needs only. Local needs information should be removed prior to sharing metadata records.</note>
				<note>The field also occurs with the following XPATH: /news-oppsRecord/contributors/contributor/organization/contactID</note>
