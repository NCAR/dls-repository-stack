				<practice status="current" originDate="2008-10-20">Select subject keywords (i.e. uncontrolled words or phrases) from either the title or description information or the content of the resource itself. If the subject of the item is a person or an organization, use the same form of the name as you would if the person or organization were a creator or other contributor. Note, however, that names of creators and other contributors should not be included as subjects unless the work is about that person (i.e., it is autobiographical).</practice><!--source:GEM and UCAR-->
