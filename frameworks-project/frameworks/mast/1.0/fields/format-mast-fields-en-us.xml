				<practice status="current" originDate="2008-10-20">Recommended best practice is to select a value from a controlled vocabulary (for example, the list of Internet Media Types [MIME] defining computer media formats).</practice><!--source:GEM-->
				<practice status="current" originDate="2008-10-20">The Format element is reserved for describing the access file only (be it image, audio, or video).</practice><!--source:CDP-->
				<practice status="current" originDate="2008-10-20">Some digital objects may involve more than one format, for example, an oral history interview may have audio formats and text format transcriptions. Use separate Format elements to enter multiple formats or clearly separate each entry by a semicolon and a space within an element.</practice><!--source:CDP-->
				<practice status="current" originDate="2008-10-20">For audio and video file formats include the duration (i.e., play time) of the resource.</practice> <!--source:CDP-->
				<practice status="current" originDate="2008-10-20">Information concerning the size of a resource may be included in the content of the Format element. In resource discovery this might be used as a criterion to select resources of interest, since a user may need to evaluate whether they can make use of the resource within the infrastructure available to them.</practice><!--source:GEM-->
