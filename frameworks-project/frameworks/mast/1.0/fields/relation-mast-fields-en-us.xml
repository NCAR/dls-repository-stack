				<practice status="current" originDate="2008-10-20">A resource may relate to another resource in a variety of ways that can be described by using more than one Relation element. For example, the same resource can be a part of a larger resource while simultaneously containing a smaller resource within itself; it can be a more recent version of one resource and be superceded by another. A resource can be a different version of another resource, or contain the same intellectual content as another resource, but be in a different format.</practice>	<!--source = CDP-->
				<practice status="current" originDate="2008-10-20">Include sufficient information in the Relation element to enable users to identify, cite, and either locate or link to the related resource.</practice>	<!--source = CDP-->
				<practice status="current" originDate="2008-10-20">Use separate Relation elements to enter multiple relations or clearly separate each entry by a semicolon and a space within an element.</practice>	<!--source = CDP-->
				<practice status="current" originDate="2008-10-20">Since the relation element identifies important related resources, wherever possible, identify that resource using a URI that can be resolved, thus providing a machine-addressable link.</practice>	<!--source=GEM-->
