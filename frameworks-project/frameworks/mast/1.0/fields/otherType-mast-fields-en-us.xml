				<practice status="current" originDate="2008-05-15">The type element should not be used to contain genre information about resources related to the one being described. For example, if the resource being described is a collection record for a set of lesson plans (i.e., a collection-level record), it should have the value "collection" assigned to the type element but "lesson plan" should not be assigned since the resource itself is not actually a lesson plan.</practice>
