				<practice status="current" originDate="2008-10-20">Coverage describes the spatial or temporal characteristics of the intellectual content of the resource. Spatial refers to the location(s) covered by the intellectual content of the resource (i.e., place names, longitude and latitude, celestial sector, etc.) not the place of publication. Temporal coverage refers to the time period covered by the intellectual content of the resource (e.g., Jurassic, 1900-1920), not the publication date. For artifacts or art objects, the spatial characteristics usually refer to the place where the artifact/object originated while the temporal characteristics refer to the date or time period during which the artifact/object was made.</practice>	<!--source:CDP-->
				<practice status="current" originDate="2008-10-20">Multiple places, physical regions, dates, and time periods may be associated with the intellectual content of the resource. No hierarchy is implied. Use separate Coverage elements to enter multiple spatial and temporal values or clearly separate each entry by a semicolon and a space within an element.</practice>	<!--source:CDP-->
				<practice status="current" originDate="2008-10-20">If using place names, select terms from a controlled vocabulary to identify place names (e.g., Geographic Names Information System (GNIS), Getty Thesaurus of Geographical Names, Library of Congress Subject Headings, etc.).</practice>	<!--source:CDP-->
