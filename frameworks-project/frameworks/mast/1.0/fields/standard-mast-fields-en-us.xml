			<practice status="current" originDate="2008-10-20">This field is for text-based entry of standards information.</practice>
			<practice status="current" originDate="2008-10-20">Useful standards metadata includes information for the following facets:  </practice>
				<practice status="current" originDate="2008-10-20">Promulgating Body - The name of the organization (governmental or otherwise) that created the set of standards being correlated;</practice>
				<practice status="current" originDate="2008-10-20">Standards Version - Standards evolve over time and it is important that the end user know the precise version of the standard used in the correlation; </practice>
				<practice status="current" originDate="2008-10-20"> Correlator - Since standards correlations involve considerable levels of subjective judgment, end users are interested in the identity of the person or organization that did the correlating;</practice>
				<practice status="current" originDate="2008-10-20"> Domain - The precise domain or subject area as defined (and stated) in the standardâ€“e.g., 'Science' or 'Mathematics'; </practice>
				<practice status="current" originDate="2008-10-20">Academic or Training Level - Where appropriate, the grade level(s) to which the promulgating body says the standard applies;</practice>
				<practice status="current" originDate="2008-10-20">Standard Text - The actual text of the academic standard.</practice>
				
				<practice status="current" originDate="2008-10-20">The standard correlation should be recorded in the metadata at the same level of granularity that is included in the resource. E.g., if a resource is correlated at a benchmark level more refined than at a top-level standards level, record the correlation at the benchmark level.</practice>
