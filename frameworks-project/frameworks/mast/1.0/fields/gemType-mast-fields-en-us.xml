				<practice status="current" originDate="2008-05-15">The type element is intended to contain statements about the genre of resource being described.</practice>
					<practice status="current" originDate="2008-05-15">Select a value from the Gateway to Educational Materials controlled vocabulary (included here).</practice>
				
<practice status="current" originDate="2008-05-15">Some digital objects may involve more than one type, e.g., a manuscript collection may have text, image, sound, and interactive components. Use separate Type elements to enter multiple types or clearly separate each entry by a semicolon and a space within an element.</practice><!--source:CDP-->

				<practice status="current" originDate="2008-05-15">The type element should not be used to contain genre information about resources related to the one being described. For example, if the resource being described is a collection record for a set of lesson plans (i.e., a collection-level record), it should have the value "collection" assigned to the type element but "lesson plan" should not be assigned since the resource itself is not actually a lesson plan.</practice>
