				<practice status="current" originDate="2008-10-20">This free-text field is intended to augment selections made from a controlled vocabulary, or used when no controlled term available is applicable.</practice> <!--source:DLS/UCAR-->
			<practice status="current" originDate="2008-10-20"> Where the creator or publisher of the resource being described explicitly states that the resource is intended to address the needs of a specific audience, information about that audience should be included by the cataloger. Thus, terms for making statements about the audience for the resource should be drawn directly from the text of the resource. Unless qualified, the cataloger should not make statements about the audience that are merely implied from the resource.</practice> <!--source:GEM-->
				<practice status="current" originDate="2008-10-20">The kinds of information about the audience that have proven useful for educators searching for resources include statements about the following audience characteristics: Mediator Roles/Characteristics (e.g., teachers, parents, administrators);  academic/training level (e.g., 5th grade students, middle school student, sophomores); beneficiary characteristics (e.g. gifted students, visually impaired students, students, cultural/linguistic groups, gender, linguistic ability, learning prerequisites, age.)</practice> <!--source:GEM-->
