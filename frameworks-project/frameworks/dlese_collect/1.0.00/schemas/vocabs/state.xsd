		<xsd:documentation>*****  stateType  *****</xsd:documentation>
		<xsd:documentation>Accessioned means accessioning criteria have been met;DLESE is receiving valid item metadata; both collection and item metadata is accessible in DLESE</xsd:documentation>
		<xsd:documentation>Approved means technical and documentation requirements have been met; collection metadata is accessible in DLESE; item metadata may not have arrived yet</xsd:documentation>
		<xsd:documentation>ConsultationOnly means the collection has not submitted metadata to DLESE nor will it become a DLESE collection. Rather the collection is using DLESE systems, services and receiving collection building support</xsd:documentation>
		<xsd:documentation>Deaccesssioned means item and collection level metadata is no longer accessible because something in the collection falls within the Deaccessioning Policy</xsd:documentation>
		<xsd:documentation>Holding means the collection is temporarily unavailable but will likely be available again soon. Reapproval is not required</xsd:documentation>
		<xsd:documentation>HostingMetadata means the collection has submitted metadata to DLESE but the collection is not appropriate for accessioning (probably out of scope); however DLESE is making the metadata available to webservices, OAI, NSDL etc. The metadata is also updated on a regular basis and the collection is receiving collection building support.</xsd:documentation>
		<xsd:documentation>Pending means the technical and documentation requirements have not been met but there is active engagement with the collection builder in order to move the collection along</xsd:documentation>
		<xsd:documentation>Potential means the initial collection building information has been provide to or discussed with a collection builder via a phone, email or RT ticket. This is more than just gathering a name a conference. Active collection building may not be occurring yet.</xsd:documentation>
		<xsd:documentation>Rejected means the collection is not accepted for accessioning. The collection may not have followed through with the accessioning process or it may have been placed on a Pending status and then did not complete the accessioning processing in a reasonable time period.</xsd:documentation>
		<xsd:documentation>Submitted means metadata records have been submitted to DLESE. Need to determine if the collection meets the requirements of accessioning. Active engagement with the collection builder is occurring.</xsd:documentation>
		<xsd:documentation>Withdrawn means either the collection builder or DLESE has decided to stop any further work on the collection. </xsd:documentation>
