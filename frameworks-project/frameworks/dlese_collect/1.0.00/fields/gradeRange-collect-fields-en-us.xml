		<bestPractices>
			<dos>
				<practice status="current" originDate="2001-04-24">Choose at least one grade range term.</practice>

				<practice status="current" originDate="2001-04-24" link1="Informal education" style1="bold" link2="General public" style2="bold">Indicate all grade ranges (this does not include Informal education or General public) that are relevant to the collection. This means select each grade range individually.</practice>

				<practice status="current" originDate="2001-04-24" link1="General public" style1="bold">If a collection is general in nature, like a group of fact sheets and does not indicate grade range specificity, then the collection is probably appropriate for many audiences. In this case, select the General public term only. Do not add other grade ranges.</practice>

				<practice status="current" originDate="2006-04-24" link1="Informal education" style1="bold">Use the Informal education term for collections specifically designed for learning environments outside of a formal classroom. These environments might include museum settings, Earth Science Week activities, community projects, park naturalists or other interpretive settings, nature centers and home schooling.</practice>
			</dos>

			<donts>
				<practice status="current" originDate="2006-04-24" link1="Informal education" style1="bold">Do not use the Informal education term to indicate the collection could be used as reference material.</practice>

				<practice status="current" originDate="2006-04-24" link1="Informal education" style1="bold">Do not use the Informal education term to indicate the collection can be used by the general public.</practice>

				<practice status="current" originDate="2001-04-24">Do choose more than 2-3 grade range terms. Most collections can be adequately described using three or less grade ranges.</practice>
