				<note>Controlled vocabulary terms are from GEM but not all the GEM terms have been adopted (e.g. learning modules).</note>
				<note>The GEM terms are available at: http://www.thegateway.org/about/documentation/gem-controlled-vocabularies/vocabulary-teaching-methods (now: http://64.119.44.148/about/documentation/gem-controlled-vocabularies/vocabulary-teaching-methods)</note>
				<note>GEM provides definitions for most terms. GEM used the following sources for definitions:</note>
				<note>DOE: A Dictionary of Education, Totowa, N.J.: Barnes &amp; Noble Books, 1982, c1981.</note>
				<note>DOE3: Dictionary of education, 3d edition; New York, McGraw-Hill, 1973.</note>
				<note>ERIC: Thesaurus of ERIC Descriptors, 13th edition; Phoenix, AZ, Oryx Press, 1995.</note>
				<note>DLESE added additional terms. DLESE wrote definitions for these terms.</note>
				<note>Any terms that GEM did not have a definition at the time of adoption, DLESE wrote a definition.</note>
