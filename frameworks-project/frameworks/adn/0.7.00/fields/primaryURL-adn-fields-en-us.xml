			<dos>
				<practice status="current" originDate="2001-01-01">Catalog URLs at an appropriate level of granularity for the type of resource being cataloged. For example, catalog lesson plans separately rather than cataloging an overarching page that lists all the lessons plans.</practice>

				<practice status="current" originDate="2001-01-01">Begin URLs with an appropriate Internet scheme like http://, ftp://, https://, etc.</practice>

				<practice status="current" originDate="2001-01-01">URLs with ampersands, equal signs, question marks, spaces, percent 20's, underscores and numbers are okay, but, if possible, minimize cataloging such URLs.</practice>

				<practice status="current" originDate="2005-03-01">If anchor links go to separate and different animations or images on a page, the anchor links may be cataloged as separate resources if appropriate.</practice>

				<practice status="current" originDate="2005-03-01">Be careful cataloging dynamic URLs that contain many symbols.</practice>
			</dos>


			<donts>
				<practice status="current" originDate="2005-03-01">Do not catalog every URL within a resource because DLESE indexes some of the resource content directly.</practice>
				<practice status="current" originDate="2005-03-01">Do not catalog anchor links within text pages. Cataloging anchor links to different animations or images is acceptable.</practice>


				<practice status="obsolete" originDate="2001-01-01" archDate="2005-03-01">Do not use other URL specifiers (ftp or https) other than http because they are not supported and will cause this tool to crash.</practice>
