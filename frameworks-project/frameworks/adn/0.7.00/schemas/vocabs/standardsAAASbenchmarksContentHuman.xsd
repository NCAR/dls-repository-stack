			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Human identity:K-2:People have different external features, such as the size, shape, and color of hair, skin, and eyes, but they are more like one another than like other animals."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Human identity:K-2:People need water, food, air, waste removal, and a particular range of temperatures in their environment, just as other animals do."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Human identity:K-2:People tend to live in families and communities in which individuals have different roles."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Human identity:3-5:Unlike in human beings, behavior in insects and many other species is determined almost entirely by biological inheritance."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Human identity:3-5:Human beings have made tools and machines to sense and do things that they could not otherwise sense or do at all, or as quickly, or as well."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Human identity:3-5:Artifacts and preserved remains provide some evidence of the physical characteristics and possible behavior of human beings who lived a very long time ago."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Human identity:6-8:Like other animals, human beings have body systems for obtaining and providing energy, defense, reproduction, and the coordination of body functions."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Human identity:6-8:Human beings have many similarities and differences. The similarities make it possible for human beings to reproduce and to donate blood and organs to one another throughout the world. Their differences enable them to create diverse social and cultural arrangements and to solve problems in a variety of ways."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Human identity:6-8:Fossil evidence is consistent with the idea that human beings evolved from earlier species."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Human identity:6-8:Specialized roles of individuals within other species are genetically programmed, whereas human beings are able to invent and modify a wider range of social behavior."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Human identity:6-8:Human beings use technology to match or excel many of the abilities of other species. Technology has helped people with disabilities survive and live more conventional lives."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Human identity:6-8:Technologies having to do with food production, sanitation, and disease prevention have dramatically changed how people live and work and have resulted in rapid increases in the human population."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Human identity:9-12:The similarity of human DNA sequences and the resulting similarity in cell chemistry and anatomy identify human beings as a single species."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Human identity:9-12:Written records and photographic and electronic devices enable human beings to share, compile, use, and misuse great amounts of information and misinformation. No other species uses such technologies."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Human development:K-2:All animals have offspring, usually with two parents involved. People may prevent some animals from producing offspring."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Human development:K-2:A human baby grows inside its mother until its birth. Even after birth, a human baby is unable to care for itself, and its survival depends on the care it receives from adults."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Human development:3-5:It takes about 9 months for a human embryo to develop. Embryos are nourished by the mother, so substances she takes in will affect how well or poorly the baby develops."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Human development:3-5:Human beings live longer than most other animals, but all living things die."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Human development:3-5:There is a usual sequence of stages in physical and mental development in human beings, although individuals differ in exactly when they reach each stage."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Human development:3-5:People are usually able to have children before they are able to care for them properly."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Human development:6-8:Fertilization occurs when sperm cells from a male's testes are deposited near an egg cell from the female ovary, and one of the sperm cells enters the egg cell. Most of the time, by chance or design, a sperm never arrives or an egg isn't available."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Human development:6-8:Contraception measures may incapacitate sperm, block their way to the egg, prevent the release of eggs, or prevent the fertilized egg from implanting successfully."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Human development:6-8:Following fertilization, cell division produces a small cluster of cells that then differentiate by appearance and function to form the basic tissues of an embryo. During the first three months of pregnancy, organs begin to form. During the second three months, all organs and body features develop. During the last three months, the organs and features mature enough to function well after birth. Patterns of human development are similar to those of other vertebrates."/>
			<!--In the next benchmark, the phrases 'embryo, and' and 'infant, encounters' originally had an m-dash between the words embryo and and and infant and encounters. The m-dash was changed to a comma because then an entity reference does not need to be used in the XML and a comma is grammatically fine.-->
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Human development:6-8:The developing embryo, and later the newborn infant, encounters many risks from faults in its genes, its mother's inadequate diet, her cigarette smoking or use of alcohol or other drugs, or from infection. Inadequate child care may lead to lower physical and mental ability."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Human development:6-8:Various body changes occur as adults age. Muscles and joints become less flexible, bones and muscles lose mass, energy levels diminish, and the senses become less acute. Women stop releasing eggs and hence can no longer reproduce. The length and quality of human life are influenced by many factors, including sanitation, diet, medical care, sex, genes, environmental conditions, and personal health behaviors."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Human development:9-12:As successive generations of an embryo's cells form by division, small differences in their immediate environments cause them to develop slightly differently, by activating or inactivating different parts of the DNA information."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Human development:9-12:Using artificial means to prevent or facilitate pregnancy raises questions of social norms, ethics, religious beliefs, and even politics."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Human development:9-12:The very long period of human development (compared to that of other species) is associated with the prominent role of the brain in human evolution. The ability to learn persists throughout life and may improve as people build a base of ideas and come to understand how to learn well. Human mental abilities that apparently evolved for survival are used for newly invented cultural purposes such as art, literature, ritual, and games."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Human development:9-12:The development and use of technologies to maintain, prolong, sustain, or terminate life raise social, moral, ethical, and legal issues."/>
			<!--In the next benchmark, the phrase 'hunger, eyes' originally had an m-dash between the words hunger and eyes. The m-dash was changed to a comma because then an entity reference does not need to be used in the XML and a comma is grammatically fine.-->
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Basic functions:K-2:The human body has parts that help it seek, find, and take in food when it feels hunger, eyes and noses for detecting food, legs to get to it, arms to carry it away, and a mouth to eat it."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Basic functions:K-2:Senses can warn individuals about danger; muscles help them to fight, hide, or get out of danger."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Basic functions:K-2:The brain enables human beings to think and sends messages to other body parts to help them work properly."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Basic functions:3-5:From food, people obtain energy and materials for body repair and growth. The indigestible parts of food are eliminated."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Basic functions:3-5:By breathing, people take in the oxygen they need to live."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Basic functions:3-5:Skin protects the body from harmful substances and other organisms and from drying out."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Basic functions:3-5:The brain gets signals from all parts of the body telling what is going on there. The brain also sends signals to parts of the body to influence what they do."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Basic functions:6-8:Organs and organ systems are composed of cells and help to provide all cells with basic needs."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Basic functions:6-8:For the body to use food for energy and building materials, the food must first be digested into molecules that are absorbed and transported to cells."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Basic functions:6-8:To burn food for the release of energy stored in it, oxygen must be supplied to cells, and carbon dioxide removed. Lungs take in oxygen for the combustion of food and they eliminate the carbon dioxide produced. The urinary system disposes of dissolved waste molecules, the intestinal tract removes solid wastes, and the skin and lungs rid the body of heat energy. The circulatory system moves all these substances to or from cells where they are needed or produced, responding to changing demands."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Basic functions:6-8:Specialized cells and the molecules they produce identify and destroy microbes that get inside the body."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Basic functions:6-8:Hormones are chemicals from glands that affect other body parts. They are involved in helping the body respond to danger and in regulating human growth, development, and reproduction."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Basic functions:6-8:Interactions among the senses, nerves, and brain make possible the learning that enables human beings to cope with changes in their environment."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Basic functions:9-12:The immune system is designed to protect against microscopic organisms and foreign substances that enter from outside the body and against some cancer cells that arise within."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Basic functions:9-12:The nervous system works by electrochemical signals in the nerves and from one nerve to the next. The hormonal system exerts its influences by chemicals that circulate in the blood. These two systems also affect each other in coordinating body systems."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Basic functions:9-12:Communication between cells is required to coordinate their diverse activities. Some cells secrete substances that spread only to nearby cells. Others secrete hormones, molecules that are carried in the bloodstream to widely distributed cells that have special receptor sites to which they attach. Along nerve cells, electrical impulses carry information much more rapidly than is possible by diffusion or blood flow. Some drugs mimic or block the molecules involved in transmitting nerve or hormone signals and therefore disturb normal operations of the brain and body."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Basic functions:9-12:Reproduction is necessary for the survival of any species. Sexual behavior depends strongly on cultural, personal, and biological factors."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Learning:K-2:People use their senses to find out about their surroundings and themselves. Different senses give different information. Sometimes a person can get different information about the same thing by moving closer to it or further away from it."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Learning:K-2:Some of the things people do, like playing soccer, reading, and writing, must be deliberately learned. Practicing helps people to improve. How well one learns sometimes depends on how one does it and how often and how hard one tries to learn."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Learning:K-2:People can learn from each other by telling and listening, showing and watching, and imitating what others do."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Learning:3-5:Human beings have different interests, motivations, skills, and talents."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Learning:3-5:Human beings can use the memory of their past experiences to make judgments about new situations."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Learning:3-5:Many skills can be practiced until they become automatic."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Learning:3-5:Human beings tend to repeat behaviors that feel good or have pleasant consequences and avoid behaviors that feel bad or have unpleasant consequences."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Learning:3-5:Learning means using what one already knows to make sense out of new experiences or information, not just storing the new information in one's head."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Learning:6-8:Some animal species are limited to a repertoire of genetically determined behaviors; others have more complex brains and can learn a wide variety of behaviors. All behavior is affected by both inheritance and experience."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Learning:6-8:The level of skill a person can reach in any particular activity depends on innate abilities, the amount of practice, and the use of appropriate learning technologies."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Learning:6-8:Human beings can detect a tremendous range of visual and olfactory stimuli. The strongest stimulus they can tolerate may be more than a trillion times as intense as the weakest they can detect. Still, there are many kinds of signals in the world that people cannot detect directly."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Learning:6-8:Attending closely to any one input of information usually reduces the ability to attend to others at the same time."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Learning:6-8:Learning often results from two perceptions or actions occurring at about the same time. The more often the same combination occurs, the stronger the mental connection between them is likely to be. Occasionally a single vivid experience will connect two things permanently in people's minds."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Learning:6-8:Language and tools enable human beings to learn complicated and varied things from others."/>
			<!--In the next benchmark, the phrase 'experience, the effect' originally had an m-dash between the words experience and the. The m-dash was changed to a comma because then an entity reference does not need to be used in the XML and a comma is grammatically fine.-->
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Learning:9-12:Differences in the behavior of individuals arise from the interaction of heredity and experience, the effect of each depends on what the other is. Even instinctive behavior may not develop well if the individual is exposed to abnormal conditions."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Learning:9-12:The expectations, moods, and prior experiences of human beings can affect how they interpret new perceptions or ideas. People tend to ignore evidence that challenges their beliefs and to accept evidence that supports them. The context in which something is learned may limit the contexts in which the learning can be used."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Learning:9-12:Human thinking involves the interaction of ideas, and ideas about ideas. People can produce many associations internally without receiving information from their senses."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Physical health:K-2:Eating a variety of healthful foods and getting enough exercise and rest help people to stay healthy."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Physical health:K-2:Some things people take into their bodies from the environment can hurt them."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Physical health:K-2:Some diseases are caused by germs, some are not. Diseases caused by germs may be spread by people who have them. Washing one's hands with soap and water reduces the number of germs that can get into the body or that can be passed on to other people."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Physical health:3-5:Food provides energy and materials for growth and repair of body parts. Vitamins and minerals, present in small amounts in foods, are essential to keep everything working well. As people grow up, the amounts and kinds of food and exercise needed by the body may change."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Physical health:3-5:Tobacco, alcohol, other drugs, and certain poisons in the environment (pesticides, lead) can harm human beings and other living things."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Physical health:3-5:If germs are able to get inside one's body, they may keep it from working properly. For defense against germs, the human body has tears, saliva, skin, some blood cells, and stomach secretions. A healthy body can fight most germs that do get inside. However, there are some germs that interfere with the body's defenses."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Physical health:3-5:There are some diseases that human beings can catch only once. After they've recovered they don't get sick from them again. There are many diseases that can be prevented by vaccination, so that people don't catch them even once."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Physical health:6-8:The amount of food energy (calories) a person requires varies with body weight, age, sex, activity level, and natural body efficiency. Regular exercise is important to maintain a healthy heart/lung system, good muscle tone, and bone strength."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Physical health:6-8:Toxic substances, some dietary habits, and personal behavior may be bad for one's health. Some effects show up right away, others may not show up for many years. Avoiding toxic substances, such as tobacco, and changing dietary habits to reduce the intake of such things as animal fat increases the chances of living longer."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Physical health:6-8:Viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites may infect the human body and interfere with normal body functions. A person can catch a cold many times because there are many varieties of cold viruses that cause similar symptoms."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Physical health:6-8:White blood cells engulf invaders or produce antibodies that attack them or mark them for killing by other white cells. The antibodies produced will remain and can fight off subsequent invaders of the same kind."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Physical health:6-8:The environment may contain dangerous levels of substances that are harmful to human beings. Therefore, the good health of individuals requires monitoring the soil, air, and water and taking steps to keep them safe."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Physical health:9-12:Some allergic reactions are caused by the body's immune responses to usually harmless environmental substances. Sometimes the immune system may attack some of the body's own cells."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Physical health:9-12:Faulty genes can cause body parts or systems to work poorly. Some genetic diseases appear only when an individual has inherited a certain faulty gene from both parents."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Physical health:9-12:New medical techniques, efficient health care delivery systems, improved sanitation, and a fuller understanding of the nature of disease give today's human beings a better chance of staying healthy than their forebears had. Conditions now are very different from the conditions in which the species evolved. But some of the differences may not be good for human health."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Physical health:9-12:Some viral diseases, such as AIDS, destroy critical cells of the immune system, leaving the body unable to deal with multiple infection agents and cancerous cells."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Mental health:K-2:People have many different feelings, sadness, joy, anger, fear, etc., about events, themselves, and other people."/>
			<!--In the next benchmark, the phrases 'feelings, sadness' and 'etc., about' originally had an m-dash between the words feelings and sadness and etc. and about. The m-dash was changed to a comma because then an entity reference does not need to be used in the XML and a comma is grammatically fine.-->
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Mental health:K-2:People react to personal problems in different ways. Some ways are more likely to be helpful than others."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Mental health:K-2:Talking to someone (a friend, relative, teacher, or counselor) may help people understand their feelings and problems and what to do about them."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Mental health:3-5:Different individuals handle their feelings differently, and sometimes they have different feelings in the same situation."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Mental health:3-5:Often human beings don't understand why others act the way they do, and sometimes they don't understand their own behavior and feelings."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Mental health:3-5:Physical health can affect people's emotional well-being and vice versa."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Mental health:3-5:One way to respond to a strong feeling, either pleasant or unpleasant, is to think about what caused it and then consider whether to seek out or avoid similar situations."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Mental health:6-8:Individuals differ greatly in their ability to cope with stressful situations. Both external and internal conditions (chemistry, personal history, values) influence how people behave."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Mental health:6-8:Often people react to mental distress by denying that they have any problem. Sometimes they don't know why they feel the way they do, but with help they can sometimes uncover the reasons."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Mental health:9-12:Stresses are especially difficult for children to deal with and may have long-lasting effects."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Mental health:9-12:Biological abnormalities, such as brain injuries or chemical imbalances, can cause or increase susceptibility to psychological disturbances."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Mental health:9-12:Reactions of other people to an individual's emotional disturbance may increase its effects."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Mental health:9-12:Human beings differ greatly in how they cope with emotions and may therefore puzzle one another."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human organism:Mental health:9-12:Ideas about what constitutes good mental health and proper treatment for abnormal mental states vary from one culture to another and from one time period to another."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human society:Cultural effects on behavior:K-2:People are alike in many ways and different in many ways."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human society:Cultural effects on behavior:K-2:Different families or classrooms have different rules and patterns of behavior. Some behaviors are not accepted in most families or schools."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human society:Cultural effects on behavior:K-2:People often choose to dress, talk, and act like their friends, do the same things they do, and have the same kinds of things they have. They also often choose to do certain things their own way."/>
			<!--In the next benchmark, the phrases 'people or' and 'characters in the media' originally had an m-dash between the words people and or and characters and in. The m-dash was changed to a space because then an entity reference does not need to be used in the XML and a space is grammatically fine.-->
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human society:Cultural effects on behavior:3-5:People can learn about others from direct experience, from the mass communications media, and from listening to other people talk about their work and their lives. People also sometimes imitate people or characters in the media."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human society:Cultural effects on behavior:3-5:People tend to feel uncomfortable with other people who dress, talk, or act very differently from themselves. What is considered to be acceptable human behavior varies from culture to culture and from one time period to another, but there are some behaviors that are unacceptable in almost all cultures, past and present."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human society:Cultural effects on behavior:6-8:Each culture has distinctive patterns of behavior, usually practiced by most of the people who grow up in it."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human society:Cultural effects on behavior:6-8:Within a large society, there may be many groups, with distinctly different subcultures associated with region, ethnic origin, or social class."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human society:Cultural effects on behavior:6-8:Although within any society there is usually broad general agreement on what behavior is unacceptable, the standards used to judge behavior vary for different settings and different subgroups, and they may change with time and different political and economic conditions. Moreover, the punishments vary widely among, and even within, different societies."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human society:Cultural effects on behavior:6-8:Technology, especially in transportation and communication, is increasingly important in spreading ideas, values, and behavior patterns within a society and among different societies. New technology can change cultural values and social behavior."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human society:Cultural effects on behavior:9-12:Cultural beliefs strongly influence the values and behavior of the people who grow up in the culture, often without their being fully aware of it. Response to these influences varies among individuals."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human society:Cultural effects on behavior:9-12:The ways that unacceptable social behavior is punished depend partly on beliefs about the purposes of punishment and about its effectiveness. Effectiveness is difficult to test scientifically because circumstances vary greatly and because legal and ethical barriers interfere."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human society:Cultural effects on behavior:9-12:Social distinctions are a part of every culture, but take many different forms, ranging from rigid classes based solely on parentage to gradations based on the acquisition of skill, wealth, or education. Differences in speech, dress, behavior, or physical features are often taken by people to be signs of social class. The difficulty of moving from one social class to another varies greatly with time, place, and economic circumstances."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human society:Cultural effects on behavior:9-12:Heredity, culture, and personal experience interact in shaping human behavior. Their relative importance in most circumstances is not clear."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human society:Group behavior:K-2:People belong to some groups by birth and belong to some groups because they join them."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human society:Group behavior:K-2:The way people act is often influenced by the groups to which they belong."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human society:Group behavior:3-5:People often like or dislike other people because of membership in or exclusion from a particular social group. Individuals tend to support members of their own group and perceive them as being like themselves."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human society:Group behavior:3-5:Different groups have different expectations for how their members should act. Sometimes the rules are written down and strictly enforced, sometimes they are just understood from example."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human society:Group behavior:3-5:When acting together, members of a group and even people in a crowd sometimes do and say things, good or bad, that they would not do or say on their own."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human society:Group behavior:6-8:Affiliation with a group can increase the power of members through pooled resources and concerted action. Joining a group often has personal advantages, such as companionship, a sense of identity, and recognition by others inside and outside the group. Group identity may create a feeling of superiority, which increases group cohesion but may also entail hostility toward other groups."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human society:Group behavior:6-8:People sometimes react to all members of a group as though they were the same and perceive in their behavior only those qualities that fit preconceptions of the group. Such stereotyping leads to uncritical judgments, such as showing blind respect for members of some groups and equally blind disrespect for members of other groups."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human society:Group behavior:9-12:The behavior of a group may not be predictable from an understanding of each of its members."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human society:Group behavior:9-12:Social organizations may serve business, political, or social purposes beyond those for which they officially exist, including unstated ones such as excluding certain categories of people from activities."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Human society:Social change:K-2:Changes happen in everyone's life, sometimes suddenly, more often slowly. People cannot control some changes, but they can usually learn to cope with them."/>

Effectiveness is difficult to test scientifically because circumstances vary greatly and because legal and ethical barriers interfere."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="Social distinctions are a part of every culture, but take many different forms, ranging from rigid classes based solely on parentage to gradations based on the acquisition of skill, wealth, or education.

Joining a group often has personal advantages, such as companionship, a sense of identity, and recognition by others inside and outside the group. Group identity may create a feeling of superiority, which increases group cohesion but may also entail hostility toward other groups."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="People sometimes react to all members of a group as though they were the same and perceive in their behavior only those qualities that fit preconceptions of the group.

The rules affect a wide range of human affairs, from marriage and education to scientific research and commerce."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="In a central-planning model, a single authority, usually a national government, decides what to produce, how to produce it, and for whom. In a free-market model, consumers and producers (individually or in organizations) make these decisions based on what they believe will benefit themselves.

The best allocation of resources is thought to be achieved through government planning by experts. Dedication to the good of the society as a whole is expected to motivate initiative, talent, and hard work. The main purpose of government is to promote comparable welfare for all individuals and groups, even at the cost of some individual and group freedoms."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="In practice, countries make compromises with regard to economic models. Central planning has to allow for some individual initiative, and markets have to provide some protection for unsuccessful competitors. The countries of the world use elements of both systems and are neither purely free-market nor entirely centrally controlled. Countries change, some adopting more free-market policies and practices, others more central-planning ones, and still others doing some of each."/>
