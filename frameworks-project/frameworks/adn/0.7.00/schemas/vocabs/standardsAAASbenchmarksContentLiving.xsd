			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Diversity of life:6-8:One of the most general distinctions among organisms is between plants, which use sunlight to make their own food, and animals, which consume energy-rich foods. Some kinds of organisms, many of them microscopic, cannot be neatly classified as either plants or animals."/>

			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Diversity of life:6-8:Similarities among organisms are found in internal anatomical features, which can be used to infer the degree of relatedness among organisms. In classifying organisms, biologists consider details of internal and external structures to be more important than behavior or general appearance."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Diversity of life:6-8:For sexually reproducing organisms, a species comprises all organisms that can mate with one another to produce fertile offspring."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Diversity of life:6-8:All organisms, including the human species, are part of and depend on two main interconnected global food webs. One includes microscopic ocean plants, the animals that feed on them, and finally the animals that feed on those animals. The other web includes land plants, the animals that feed on them, and so forth. The cycles continue indefinitely because organisms decompose after death to return food material to the environment."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Diversity of life:9-12:The variation of organisms within a species increases the likelihood that at least some members of the species will survive under changed environmental conditions, and a great diversity of species increases the chance that at least some living things will survive in the face of large changes in the environment."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Diversity of life:9-12:The degree of kinship between organisms or species can be estimated from the similarity of their DNA sequences, which often closely matches their classification based on anatomical similarities."/>

			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Heredity:K-2:Offspring are very much, but not exactly, like their parents and like one another."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Heredity:3-5:Some likenesses between children and parents, such as eye color in human beings, or fruit or flower color in plants, are inherited. Other likenesses, such as people's table manners or carpentry skills, are learned."/>

			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Heredity:6-8:In some kinds of organisms, all the genes come from a single parent, whereas in organisms that have sexes, typically half of the genes come from each parent."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Heredity:6-8:In sexual reproduction, a single specialized cell from a female merges with a specialized cell from a male. As the fertilized egg, carrying genetic information from each parent, multiplies to form the complete organism with about a trillion cells, the same genetic information is copied in each cell."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Heredity:6-8:New varieties of cultivated plants and domestic animals have resulted from selective breeding for particular traits."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Heredity:9-12:Some new gene combinations make little difference, some can produce organisms with new and perhaps enhanced capabilities, and some can be deleterious."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Heredity:9-12:The sorting and recombination of genes in sexual reproduction results in a great variety of possible gene combinations from the offspring of any two parents."/>

			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Heredity:9-12:Genes are segments of DNA molecules. Inserting, deleting, or substituting DNA segments can alter genes. An altered gene may be passed on to every cell that develops from it. The resulting features may help, harm, or have little or no effect on the offspring's success in its environment."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Heredity:9-12:Gene mutations can be caused by such things as radiation and chemicals. When they occur in sex cells, the mutations can be passed on to offspring; if they occur in other cells, they can be passed on to descendant cells only. The experiences an organism has during its lifetime can affect its offspring only if the genes in its own sex cells are changed by the experience."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Heredity:9-12:The many body cells in an individual can be very different from one another, even though they are all descended from a single cell and thus have essentially identical genetic instructions. Different parts of the instructions are used in different types of cells, influenced by the cell's environment and past history."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Cells:K-2:Magnifiers help people see things they could not see without them."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Cells:K-2:Most living things need water, food, and air."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Cells:3-5:Some living things consist of a single cell. Like familiar organisms, they need food, water, and air; a way to dispose of waste; and an environment they can live in."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Cells:3-5:Microscopes make it possible to see that living things are made mostly of cells. Some organisms are made of a collection of similar cells that benefit from cooperating. Some organisms' cells vary greatly in appearance and perform very different roles in the organism."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Cells:6-8:All living things are composed of cells, from just one to many millions, whose details usually are visible only through a microscope. Different body tissues and organs are made up of different kinds of cells. The cells in similar tissues and organs in other animals are similar to those in human beings but differ somewhat from cells found in plants."/>
			<!--In the next benchmark, the phrases 'organisms, such' and 'waste, are' originally had an m-dash between the words organisms and such and waste and are . The m-dash was changed to a comma because then an entity reference does not need to be used in the XML and a comma is grammatically fine.-->
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Cells:6-8:Cells repeatedly divide to make more cells for growth and repair. Various organs and tissues function to serve the needs of cells for food, air, and waste removal."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Cells:6-8:Within cells, many of the basic functions of organisms, such as extracting energy from food and getting rid of waste, are carried out. The way in which cells function is similar in all living organisms."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Cells:6-8:About two thirds of the weight of cells is accounted for by water, which gives cells many of their properties."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Cells:9-12:Every cell is covered by a membrane that controls what can enter and leave the cell. In all but quite primitive cells, a complex network of proteins provides organization and shape and, for animal cells, movement."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Cells:9-12:Within every cell are specialized parts for the transport of materials, energy transfer, protein building, waste disposal, information feedback, and even movement. In addition, most cells in multicellular organisms perform some special functions that others do not."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Cells:9-12:The work of the cell is carried out by the many different types of molecules it assembles, mostly proteins. Protein molecules are long, usually folded chains made from 20 different kinds of amino-acid molecules. The function of each protein molecule depends on its specific sequence of amino acids and the shape the chain takes is a consequence of attractions between the chain's parts."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Cells:9-12:The genetic information encoded in DNA molecules provides instructions for assembling protein molecules. The code used is virtually the same for all life forms.  Before a cell divides, the instructions are duplicated so that each of the two new cells gets all the necessary information for carrying on."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Cells:9-12:Complex interactions among the different kinds of molecules in the cell cause distinct cycles of activities, such as growth and division. Cell behavior can also be affected by molecules from other parts of the organism or even other organisms."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Cells:9-12:Gene mutation in a cell can result in uncontrolled cell division, called cancer. Exposure of cells to certain chemicals and radiation increases mutations and thus increases the chance of cancer."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Cells:9-12:Most cells function best within a narrow range of temperature and acidity. At very low temperatures, reaction rates are too slow. High temperatures and/or extremes of acidity can irreversibly change the structure of most protein molecules. Even small changes in acidity can alter the molecules and how they interact. Both single cells and multicellular organisms have molecules that help to keep the cell's acidity within a narrow range."/>
			<!--In the next benchmark, added a comma between the words elements and mainly to be more grammatically correct.-->
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Cells:9-12:A living cell is composed of a small number of chemical elements, mainly carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, and sulfur. Carbon atoms can easily bond to several other carbon atoms in chains and rings to form large and complex molecules."/>

			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Interdependence of life:K-2:Living things are found almost everywhere in the world. There are somewhat different kinds in different places."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Interdependence of life:3-5:For any particular environment, some kinds of plants and animals survive well, some survive less well, and some cannot survive at all."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Interdependence of life:3-5:Insects and various other organisms depend on dead plant and animal material for food."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Interdependence of life:3-5:Organisms interact with one another in various ways besides providing food. Many plants depend on animals for carrying their pollen to other plants or for dispersing their seeds."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Interdependence of life:3-5:Changes in an organism's habitat are sometimes beneficial to it and sometimes harmful."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Interdependence of life:3-5:Most microorganisms do not cause disease, and many are beneficial."/>
			<!--In the next benchmark, the phrases 'environments, freshwater' and 'others, organisms' originally had an m-dash between the words environments and freshwater and other and organisms. The m-dash was changed to a comma because then an entity reference does not need to be used in the XML and a comma is grammatically fine.-->
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Interdependence of life:6-8:In all environments, freshwater, marine, forest, desert, grassland, mountain, and others, organisms with similar needs may compete with one another for resources, including food, space, water, air, and shelter. In any particular environment, the growth and survival of organisms depend on the physical conditions."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Interdependence of life:6-8:Two types of organisms may interact with one another in several ways: They may be in a producer/consumer, predator/prey, or parasite/host relationship. Or one organism may scavenge or decompose another. Relationships may be competitive or mutually beneficial. Some species have become so adapted to each other that neither could survive without the other."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Interdependence of life:9-12:Ecosystems can be reasonably stable over hundreds or thousands of years. As any population of organisms grows, it is held in check by one or more environmental factors: depletion of food or nesting sites, increased loss to increased numbers of predators, or parasites. If a disaster such as flood or fire occurs, the damaged ecosystem is likely to recover in stages that eventually result in a system similar to the original one."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Interdependence of life:9-12:Like many complex systems, ecosystems tend to have cyclic fluctuations around a state of rough equilibrium. In the long run, however, ecosystems always change when climate changes or when one or more new species appear as a result of migration or local evolution."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Interdependence of life:9-12:Human beings are part of the earth's ecosystems. Human activities can, deliberately or inadvertently, alter the equilibrium in ecosystems."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Flow of matter and energy:K-2:Plants and animals both need to take in water, and animals need to take in food. In addition, plants need light."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Flow of matter and energy:K-2:Many materials can be recycled and used again, sometimes in different forms."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Flow of matter and energy:3-5:Almost all kinds of animals' food can be traced back to plants."/>
			<!--In the next benchmark, the word 'energy' originally had double quotes surrounding it. The double quotes were replaced with single quotes because a double quote is a reserved character in XML schema.-->
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Flow of matter and energy:3-5:Some source of 'energy' is needed for all organisms to stay alive and grow."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Flow of matter and energy:3-5:Over the whole earth, organisms are growing, dying, and decaying, and new organisms are being produced by the old ones."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Flow of matter and energy:6-8:Food provides molecules that serve as fuel and building material for all organisms. Plants use the energy in light to make sugars out of carbon dioxide and water. This food can be used immediately for fuel or materials or it may be stored for later use. Organisms that eat plants break down the plant structures to produce the materials and energy they need to survive. Then they are consumed by other organisms."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Flow of matter and energy:6-8:Over a long time, matter is transferred from one organism to another repeatedly and between organisms and their physical environment. As in all material systems, the total amount of matter remains constant, even though its form and location change."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Flow of matter and energy:6-8:Energy can change from one form to another in living things. Animals get energy from oxidizing their food, releasing some of its energy as heat. Almost all food energy comes originally from sunlight."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Flow of matter and energy:9-12:At times, environmental conditions are such that plants and marine organisms grow faster than decomposers can recycle them back to the environment. Layers of energy-rich organic material have been gradually turned into great coal beds and oil pools by the pressure of the overlying earth. By burning these fossil fuels, people are passing most of the stored energy back into the environment as heat and releasing large amounts of carbon dioxide."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Flow of matter and energy:9-12:The amount of life any environment can support is limited by the available energy, water, oxygen, and minerals, and by the ability of ecosystems to recycle the residue of dead organic materials. Human activities and technology can change the flow and reduce the fertility of the land."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Flow of matter and energy:9-12:The chemical elements that make up the molecules of living things pass through food webs and are combined and recombined in different ways. At each link in a food web, some energy is stored in newly made structures but much is dissipated into the environment as heat. Continual input of energy from sunlight keeps the process going."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Evolution of life:K-2:Different plants and animals have external features that help them thrive in different kinds of places."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Evolution of life:K-2:Some kinds of organisms that once lived on earth have completely disappeared, although they were something like others that are alive today."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Evolution of life:3-5:Individuals of the same kind differ in their characteristics, and sometimes the differences give individuals an advantage in surviving and reproducing."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Evolution of life:3-5:Fossils can be compared to one another and to living organisms according to their similarities and differences. Some organisms that lived long ago are similar to existing organisms, but some are quite different."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Evolution of life:6-8:Small differences between parents and offspring can accumulate (through selective breeding) in successive generations so that descendants are very different from their ancestors."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Evolution of life:6-8:Individual organisms with certain traits are more likely than others to survive and have offspring. Changes in environmental conditions can affect the survival of individual organisms and entire species."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Evolution of life:6-8:Many thousands of layers of sedimentary rock provide evidence for the long history of the earth and for the long history of changing life forms whose remains are found in the rocks. More recently deposited rock layers are more likely to contain fossils resembling existing species."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Evolution of life:9-12:The basic idea of biological evolution is that the earth's present-day species developed from earlier, distinctly different species."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Evolution of life:9-12:Molecular evidence substantiates the anatomical evidence for evolution and provides additional detail about the sequence in which various lines of descent branched off from one another."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Evolution of life:9-12:Natural selection provides the following mechanism for evolution: Some variation in heritable characteristics exists within every species, some of these characteristics give individuals an advantage over others in surviving and reproducing, and the advantaged offspring, in turn, are more likely than others to survive and reproduce. The proportion of individuals that have advantageous characteristics will increase."/>
			<!--In the next benchmark, the phrase 'levels, in' originally had an m-dash between the words levels and in. The m-dash was changed to a comma because then an entity reference does not need to be used in the XML and a comma is grammatically fine.-->
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Evolution of life:9-12:Heritable characteristics can be observed at molecular and whole-organism levels, in structure, chemistry, or behavior. These characteristics strongly influence what capabilities an organism will have and how it will react, and therefore influence how likely it is to survive and reproduce."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Evolution of life:9-12:New heritable characteristics can result from new combinations of existing genes or from mutations of genes in reproductive cells.  Changes in other cells of an organism cannot be passed on to the next generation."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Evolution of life:9-12:Natural selection leads to organisms that are well suited for survival in particular environments.  Chance alone can result in the persistence of some heritable characteristics having no survival or reproductive advantage or disadvantage for the organism.  When an environment changes, the survival value of some inherited characteristics may change."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Evolution of life:9-12:The theory of natural selection provides a scientific explanation for the history of life on earth as depicted in the fossil record and in the similarities evident within the diversity of existing organisms."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Evolution of life:9-12:Life on earth is thought to have begun as simple, one-celled organisms about 4 billion years ago.  During the first 2 billion years, only single-cell microorganisms existed, but once cells with nuclei developed about a billion years ago, increasingly complex multicellular organisms evolved."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Living environment:Evolution of life:9-12:Evolution builds on what already exists, so the more variety there is, the more there can be in the future.  But evolution does not necessitate long-term progress in some set direction.  Evolutionary changes appear to be like the growth of a bush:  Some branches survive from the beginning with little or no change, many die out altogether, and others branch repeatedly, sometimes giving rise to more complex organisms."/>

Before a cell divides, the instructions are duplicated so that each of the two new cells gets all the necessary information for carrying on."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="Complex interactions among the different kinds of molecules in the cell cause distinct cycles of activities, such as growth and division. Cell behavior can also be affected by molecules from other parts of the organism or even other organisms."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="Gene mutation in a cell can result in uncontrolled cell division, called cancer. Exposure of cells to certain chemicals and radiation increases mutations and thus increases the chance of cancer."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="Most cells function best within a narrow range of temperature and acidity. At very low temperatures, reaction rates are too slow. High temperatures and/or extremes of acidity can irreversibly change the structure of most protein molecules. Even small changes in acidity can alter the molecules and how they interact. Both single cells and multicellular organisms have molecules that help to keep the cell's acidity within a narrow range."/>
			<!--In the next benchmark, added a comma between the words elements and mainly to be more grammatically correct.-->
			<xsd:enumeration value="A living cell is composed of a small number of chemical elements, mainly carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, and sulfur. Carbon atoms can easily bond to several other carbon atoms in chains and rings to form large and complex molecules."/>

			<xsd:enumeration value="Most microorganisms do not cause disease, and many are beneficial."/>
			<!--In the next benchmark, the phrases 'environments, freshwater' and 'others, organisms' originally had an m-dash between the words environments and freshwater and other and organisms. The m-dash was changed to a comma because then an entity reference does not need to be used in the XML and a comma is grammatically fine.-->
			<xsd:enumeration value="In all environments, freshwater, marine, forest, desert, grassland, mountain, and others, organisms with similar needs may compete with one another for resources, including food, space, water, air, and shelter. In any particular environment, the growth and survival of organisms depend on the physical conditions."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="Two types of organisms may interact with one another in several ways: They may be in a producer/consumer, predator/prey, or parasite/host relationship. Or one organism may scavenge or decompose another. Relationships may be competitive or mutually beneficial. Some species have become so adapted to each other that neither could survive without the other."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="Ecosystems can be reasonably stable over hundreds or thousands of years. As any population of organisms grows, it is held in check by one or more environmental factors: depletion of food or nesting sites, increased loss to increased numbers of predators, or parasites. If a disaster such as flood or fire occurs, the damaged ecosystem is likely to recover in stages that eventually result in a system similar to the original one."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="Like many complex systems, ecosystems tend to have cyclic fluctuations around a state of rough equilibrium. In the long run, however, ecosystems always change when climate changes or when one or more new species appear as a result of migration or local evolution."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="Human beings are part of the earth's ecosystems. Human activities can, deliberately or inadvertently, alter the equilibrium in ecosystems."/>

			<!--In the next benchmark, the word 'energy' originally had double quotes surrounding it. The double quotes were replaced with single quotes because a double quote is a reserved character in XML schema.-->
			<xsd:enumeration value="Some source of 'energy' is needed for all organisms to stay alive and grow."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="Over the whole earth, organisms are growing, dying, and decaying, and new organisms are being produced by the old ones."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="Food provides molecules that serve as fuel and building material for all organisms. Plants use the energy in light to make sugars out of carbon dioxide and water. This food can be used immediately for fuel or materials or it may be stored for later use. Organisms that eat plants break down the plant structures to produce the materials and energy they need to survive. Then they are consumed by other organisms."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="Over a long time, matter is transferred from one organism to another repeatedly and between organisms and their physical environment. As in all material systems, the total amount of matter remains constant, even though its form and location change."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="Energy can change from one form to another in living things. Animals get energy from oxidizing their food, releasing some of its energy as heat. Almost all food energy comes originally from sunlight."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="At times, environmental conditions are such that plants and marine organisms grow faster than decomposers can recycle them back to the environment. Layers of energy-rich organic material have been gradually turned into great coal beds and oil pools by the pressure of the overlying earth. By burning these fossil fuels, people are passing most of the stored energy back into the environment as heat and releasing large amounts of carbon dioxide."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="The amount of life any environment can support is limited by the available energy, water, oxygen, and minerals, and by the ability of ecosystems to recycle the residue of dead organic materials. Human activities and technology can change the flow and reduce the fertility of the land."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="The chemical elements that make up the molecules of living things pass through food webs and are combined and recombined in different ways. At each link in a food web, some energy is stored in newly made structures but much is dissipated into the environment as heat. Continual input of energy from sunlight keeps the process going."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="Different plants and animals have external features that help them thrive in different kinds of places."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="Some kinds of organisms that once lived on earth have completely disappeared, although they were something like others that are alive today."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="Individuals of the same kind differ in their characteristics, and sometimes the differences give individuals an advantage in surviving and reproducing."/>

			<xsd:enumeration value="Small differences between parents and offspring can accumulate (through selective breeding) in successive generations so that descendants are very different from their ancestors."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="Individual organisms with certain traits are more likely than others to survive and have offspring. Changes in environmental conditions can affect the survival of individual organisms and entire species."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="Many thousands of layers of sedimentary rock provide evidence for the long history of the earth and for the long history of changing life forms whose remains are found in the rocks. More recently deposited rock layers are more likely to contain fossils resembling existing species."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="The basic idea of biological evolution is that the earth's present-day species developed from earlier, distinctly different species."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="Molecular evidence substantiates the anatomical evidence for evolution and provides additional detail about the sequence in which various lines of descent branched off from one another."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="Natural selection provides the following mechanism for evolution: Some variation in heritable characteristics exists within every species, some of these characteristics give individuals an advantage over others in surviving and reproducing, and the advantaged offspring, in turn, are more likely than others to survive and reproduce. The proportion of individuals that have advantageous characteristics will increase."/>
			<!--In the next benchmark, the phrase 'levels, in' originally had an m-dash between the words levels and in. The m-dash was changed to a comma because then an entity reference does not need to be used in the XML and a comma is grammatically fine.-->
			<xsd:enumeration value="Heritable characteristics can be observed at molecular and whole-organism levels, in structure, chemistry, or behavior. These characteristics strongly influence what capabilities an organism will have and how it will react, and therefore influence how likely it is to survive and reproduce."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="New heritable characteristics can result from new combinations of existing genes or from mutations of genes in reproductive cells.  Changes in other cells of an organism cannot be passed on to the next generation."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="Natural selection leads to organisms that are well suited for survival in particular environments.  Chance alone can result in the persistence of some heritable characteristics having no survival or reproductive advantage or disadvantage for the organism.  When an environment changes, the survival value of some inherited characteristics may change."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="The theory of natural selection provides a scientific explanation for the history of life on earth as depicted in the fossil record and in the similarities evident within the diversity of existing organisms."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="Life on earth is thought to have begun as simple, one-celled organisms about 4 billion years ago.  During the first 2 billion years, only single-cell microorganisms existed, but once cells with nuclei developed about a billion years ago, increasingly complex multicellular organisms evolved."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="Evolution builds on what already exists, so the more variety there is, the more there can be in the future.  But evolution does not necessitate long-term progress in some set direction.  Evolutionary changes appear to be like the growth of a bush:  Some branches survive from the beginning with little or no change, many die out altogether, and others branch repeatedly, sometimes giving rise to more complex organisms."/>
