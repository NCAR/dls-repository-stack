				<practice status="current" originDate="2001-01-01">Choose at least one grade range term.</practice>

				<practice status="current" originDate="2001-01-01" link1="Informal education" style1="bold" link2="General public" style2="bold">Indicate all grade ranges (this does not include Informal education or General public) that are relevant to the resource. This means select each grade range individually.</practice>

				<practice status="current" originDate="2001-01-01" link1="General public" style1="bold">If a resource is general in nature, like a fact sheet, and does not indicate grade range specificity, then the resource is probably appropriate for many audiences. In this case, select the General public term only. Do not add other grade ranges.</practice>

				<practice status="current" originDate="2001-01-01" link1="Informal education" style1="bold">Use the Informal education term for resources specifically designed for learning environments outside of a formal classroom. These environments might include museum settings, Earth Science Week activities, community projects, park naturalists or other interpretive settings, nature centers and home schooling.</practice>

				<practice status="current" originDate="2001-01-01">Do choose more than 2-3 grade range terms. Most resources can be adequately described using three or less grade ranges.</practice>

				<practice status="obsolete" originDate="2001-01-01" archDate="2005-03-03">Do not exceed 8 different audiences. Generally, most resources have 2-4 appropriate audiences.</practice>
