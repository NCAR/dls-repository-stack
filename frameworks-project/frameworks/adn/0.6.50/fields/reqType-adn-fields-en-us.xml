The chances of a resource needing all these viewers at the same time is highly unlikely because some of these players do the same thing.

				<practice status="obsolete" originDate="2001-01-01" archDate="2001-01-01">Do not choose multiple viewers, like QuikTime, Shockwave, Media Player and Real Player, just because the resource works in multiple viewers. This is a example to avoid. Catalogers have entered many different plug-ins like QuikTime, Shockwave, Media Player and Real Player all in one record. The chances of a resource needing 4 of these at one time is highly unlikely because some of these players do the same thing. So please before careful and for such a situation consider doing the following. Select "Other:More specific technical requirements" and saying in the Additional Information box that this site has imagery that may require one of the following viewers QuikTime, Shockwave, Media Player or Real Player. </practice> -->
