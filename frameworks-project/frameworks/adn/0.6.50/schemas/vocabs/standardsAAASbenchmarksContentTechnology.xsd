			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of technology:Technology and science:K-2:When trying to build something or to get something to work better, it usually helps to follow directions if there are any or to ask someone who has done it before for suggestions."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of technology:Technology and science:3-5:Throughout all of history, people everywhere have invented and used tools. Most tools of today are different from those of the past but many are modifications of very ancient tools."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of technology:Technology and science:3-5:Technology enables scientists and others to observe things that are too small or too far away to be seen without them and to study the motion of objects that are moving very rapidly or are hardly moving at all."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of technology:Technology and science:3-5:Measuring instruments can be used to gather accurate information for making scientific comparisons of objects and events and for designing and constructing things that will work properly."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of technology:Technology and science:3-5:Technology extends the ability of people to change the world: to cut, shape, or put together materials; to move things from one place to another; and to reach farther with their hands, voices, senses, and minds. The changes may be for survival needs such as food, shelter, and defense, for communication and transportation, or to gain knowledge and express ideas."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of technology:Technology and science:6-8:In earlier times, the accumulated information and techniques of each generation of workers were taught on the job directly to the next generation of workers. Today, the knowledge base for technology can be found as well in libraries of print and electronic resources and is often taught in the classroom."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of technology:Technology and science:6-8:Technology is essential to science for such purposes as access to outer space and other remote locations, sample collection and treatment, measurement, data collection and storage, computation, and communication of information."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of technology:Technology and science:6-8:Engineers, architects, and others who engage in design and technology use scientific knowledge to solve practical problems. But they usually have to take human values and limitations into account as well."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of technology:Technology and science:9-12:Technological problems often create a demand for new scientific knowledge, and new technologies make it possible for scientists to extend their research in new ways or to undertake entirely new lines of research. The very availability of new technology itself often sparks scientific advances."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of technology:Technology and science:9-12:Mathematics, creativity, logic and originality are all needed to improve technology."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of technology:Technology and science:9-12:Technology usually affects society more directly than science because it solves practical problems and serves human needs (and may create new problems and needs). In contrast, science affects society mainly by stimulating and satisfying people's curiosity and occasionally by enlarging or challenging their views of what the world is like."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of technology:Design and systems:K-2:People may not be able to actually make or do everything that they can design."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of technology:Design and systems:3-5:There is no perfect design. Designs that are best in one respect (safety or ease of use, for example) may be inferior in other ways (cost or appearance). Usually some features must be sacrificed to get others. How such trade-offs are received depends upon which features are emphasized and which are down-played."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of technology:Design and systems:3-5:Even a good design may fail. Sometimes steps can be taken ahead of time to reduce the likelihood of failure, but it cannot be entirely eliminated."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of technology:Design and systems:3-5:The solution to one problem may create other problems."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of technology:Design and systems:6-8:Design usually requires taking constraints into account. Some constraints, such as gravity or the properties of the materials to be used, are unavoidable. Other constraints, including economic, political, social, ethical, and aesthetic ones, limit choices."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of technology:Design and systems:6-8:All technologies have effects other than those intended by the design, some of which may have been predictable and some not. In either case, these side effects may turn out to be unacceptable to some of the population and therefore lead to conflict between groups."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of technology:Design and systems:6-8:Almost all control systems have inputs, outputs, and feedback. The essence of control is comparing information about what is happening to what people want to happen and then making appropriate adjustments. This procedure requires sensing information, processing it, and making changes. In almost all modern machines, microprocessors serve as centers of performance control."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of technology:Design and systems:6-8:Systems fail because they have faulty or poorly matched parts, are used in ways that exceed what was intended by the design, or were poorly designed to begin with. The most common ways to prevent failure are pretesting parts and procedures, overdesign, and redundancy."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of technology:Design and systems:9-12:In designing a device or process, thought should be given to how it will be manufactured, operated, maintained, replaced, and disposed of and who will sell, operate, and take care of it. The costs associated with these functions may introduce yet more constraints on the design."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of technology:Design and systems:9-12:The value of any given technology may be different for different groups of people and at different points in time."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of technology:Design and systems:9-12:Complex systems have layers of controls. Some controls operate particular parts of the system and some control other controls. Even fully automatic systems require human control at some point."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of technology:Design and systems:9-12:Risk analysis is used to minimize the likelihood of unwanted side effects of a new technology. The public perception of risk may depend, however, on psychological factors as well as scientific ones."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of technology:Design and systems:9-12:The more parts and connections a system has, the more ways it can go wrong. Complex systems usually have components to detect, back up, bypass, or compensate for minor failures."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of technology:Design and systems:9-12:To reduce the chance of system failure, performance testing is often conducted using small-scale models, computer simulations, analogous systems, or just the parts of the system thought to be least reliable."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of technology:Issues in technology:K-2:People, alone or in groups, are always inventing new ways to solve problems and get work done. The tools and ways of doing things that people have invented affect all aspects of life."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of technology:Issues in technology:K-2:When a group of people wants to build something or try something new, they should try to figure out ahead of time how it might affect other people."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of technology:Issues in technology:3-5:Technology has been part of life on the earth since the advent of the human species. Like language, ritual, commerce, and the arts, technology is an intrinsic part of human culture, and it both shapes society and is shaped by it. The technology available to people greatly influences what their lives are like."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of technology:Issues in technology:3-5:Any invention is likely to lead to other inventions. Once an invention exists, people are likely to think up ways of using it that were never imagined at first."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of technology:Issues in technology:3-5:Transportation, communications, nutrition, sanitation, health care, entertainment, and other technologies give large numbers of people today the goods and services that once were luxuries enjoyed only by the wealthy. These benefits are not equally available to everyone."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of technology:Issues in technology:3-5:Scientific laws, engineering principles, properties of materials, and construction techniques must be taken into account in designing engineering solutions to problems. Other factors, such as cost, safety, appearance, environmental impact, and what will happen if the solution fails also must be considered."/>
			<!--In the next benchmark, the phrase 'others, either' originally had an m-dash between the words others and either. The m-dash was changed to a comma because then an entity reference does not need to be used in the XML and a comma is grammatically fine.-->
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of technology:Issues in technology:3-5:Technologies often have drawbacks as well as benefits. A technology that helps some people or organisms may hurt others, either deliberately (as weapons can) or inadvertently (as pesticides can). When harm occurs or seems likely, choices have to be made or new solutions found."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of technology:Issues in technology:3-5:Because of their ability to invent tools and processes, people have an enormous effect on the lives of other living things."/>
			<!--In the next benchmark, the phrase 'technologies and' originally had an m-dash between the words technologies and and. The m-dash was changed to a space because then an entity reference does not need to be used in the XML and a space is grammatically fine.-->

			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of technology:Issues in technology:6-8:Throughout history, people have carried out impressive technological feats, some of which would be hard to duplicate today even with modern tools. The purposes served by these achievements have sometimes been practical, sometimes ceremonial."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of technology:Issues in technology:6-8:Technology has strongly influenced the course of history and continues to do so. It is largely responsible for the great revolutions in agriculture, manufacturing, sanitation and medicine, warfare, transportation, information processing, and communications that have radically changed how people live."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of technology:Issues in technology:6-8:New technologies increase some risks and decrease others. Some of the same technologies that have improved the length and quality of life for many people have also brought new risks."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of technology:Issues in technology:6-8:Rarely are technology issues simple and one-sided. Relevant facts alone, even when known and available, usually do not settle matters entirely in favor of one side or another. That is because the contending groups may have different values and priorities. They may stand to gain or lose in different degrees, or may make very different predictions about what the future consequences of the proposed action will be."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of technology:Issues in technology:6-8:Societies influence what aspects of technology are developed and how these are used. People control technology (as well as science) and are responsible for its effects."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of technology:Issues in technology:9-12:Social and economic forces strongly influence which technologies will be developed and used. Which will prevail is affected by many factors, such as personal values, consumer acceptance, patent laws, the availability of risk capital, the federal budget, local and national regulations, media attention, economic competition, and tax incentives."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of technology:Issues in technology:9-12:Technological knowledge is not always as freely shared as scientific knowledge unrelated to technology. Some scientists and engineers are comfortable working in situations in which some secrecy is required, but others prefer not to do so. It is generally regarded as a matter of individual choice and ethics, not one of professional ethics."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of technology:Issues in technology:9-12:In deciding on proposals to introduce new technologies or to curtail existing ones, some key questions arise concerning alternatives, risks, costs, and benefits. What alternative ways are there to achieve the same ends, and how do the alternatives compare to the plan being put forward? Who benefits and who suffers? What are the financial and social costs, do they change over time, and who bears them? What are the risks associated with using (or not using) the new technology, how serious are they, and who is in jeopardy? What human, material, and energy resources will be needed to build, install, operate, maintain, and replace the new technology, and where will they come from? How will the new technology and its waste products be disposed of and at what costs?"/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of technology:Issues in technology:9-12:The human species has a major impact on other species in many ways: reducing the amount of the earth's surface available to those other species, interfering with their food sources, changing the temperature and chemical composition of their habitats, introducing foreign species into their ecosystems, and altering organisms directly through selective breeding and genetic engineering."/>
