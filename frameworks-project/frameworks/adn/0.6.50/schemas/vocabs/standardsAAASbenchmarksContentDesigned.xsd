			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Agriculture:K-2:Most food comes from farms either directly as crops or as the animals that eat the crops. To grow well, plants need enough warmth, light, and water. Crops also must be protected from weeds and pests that can harm them."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Agriculture:K-2:Part of a crop may be lost to pests or spoilage."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Agriculture:K-2:A crop that is fine when harvested may spoil before it gets to consumers."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Agriculture:K-2:Machines improve what people get from crops by helping in planting and harvesting, in keeping food fresh by packaging and cooling, and in moving it long distances from where it is grown to where people live."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Agriculture:3-5:Some plant varieties and animal breeds have more desirable characteristics than others, but some may be more difficult or costly to grow. The kinds of crops that can grow in an area depend on the climate and soil. Irrigation and fertilizers can help crops grow in places where there is too little water or the soil is poor."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Agriculture:3-5:The damage to crops caused by rodents, weeds, and insects can be reduced by using poisons, but their use may harm other plants or animals as well, and pests tend to develop resistance to poisons."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Agriculture:3-5:Heating, salting, smoking, drying, cooling, and airtight packaging are ways to slow down the spoiling of food by microscopic organisms. These methods make it possible for food to be stored for long intervals before being used."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Agriculture:3-5:Modern technology has increased the efficiency of agriculture so that fewer people are needed to work on farms than ever before."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Agriculture:3-5:Places too cold or dry to grow certain crops can obtain food from places with more suitable climates. Much of the food eaten by Americans comes from other parts of the country and other places in the world."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Agriculture:6-8:Early in human history, there was an agricultural revolution in which people changed from hunting and gathering to farming. This allowed changes in the division of labor between men and women and between children and adults, and the development of new patterns of government."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Agriculture:6-8:People control the characteristics of plants and animals they raise by selective breeding and by preserving varieties of seeds (old and new) to use if growing conditions change."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Agriculture:6-8:In agriculture, as in all technologies, there are always trade-offs to be made. Getting food from many different places makes people less dependent on weather in any one place, yet more dependent on transportation and communication among far-flung markets. Specializing in one crop may risk disaster if changes in weather or increases in pest populations wipe out that crop. Also, the soil may be exhausted of some nutrients, which can be replenished by rotating the right crops."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Agriculture:6-8:Many people work to bring food, fiber, and fuel to US markets. With improved technology, only a small fraction of workers in the United States actually plant and harvest the products that people use. Most workers are engaged in processing, packaging, transporting, and selling what is produced."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Agriculture:9-12:New varieties of farm plants and animals have been engineered by manipulating their genetic instructions to produce new characteristics."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Agriculture:9-12:Government sometimes intervenes in matching agricultural supply to demand in an attempt to ensure a stable, high-quality, and inexpensive food supply. Regulations are often also designed to protect farmers from abrupt changes in farming conditions and from competition by farmers in other countries."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Agriculture:9-12:Agricultural technology requires tradeoffs between increased production and environmental harm and between efficient production and social values. In the past century, agricultural technology led to a huge shift of population from farms to cities and a great change in how people live and work."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Materials and manufacturing:K-2:Some kinds of materials are better than others for making any particular thing. Materials that are better in some ways (such as stronger or cheaper) may be worse in other ways (heavier or harder to cut)."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Materials and manufacturing:K-2:Several steps are usually involved in making things."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Materials and manufacturing:K-2:Tools are used to help make things, and some things cannot be made at all without tools. Each kind of tool has a special purpose."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Materials and manufacturing:K-2:Some materials can be used over again."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Materials and manufacturing:3-5:Naturally occurring materials such as wood, clay, cotton, and animal skins may be processed or combined with other materials to change their properties."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Materials and manufacturing:3-5:Through science and technology, a wide variety of materials that do not appear in nature at all have become available, ranging from steel to nylon to liquid crystals."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Materials and manufacturing:3-5:Discarded products contribute to the problem of waste disposal. Sometimes it is possible to use the materials in them to make new products, but materials differ widely in the ease with which they can be recycled."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Materials and manufacturing:3-5:Through mass production, the time required to make a product and its cost can be greatly reduced. Although many things are still made by hand in some parts of the world, almost everything in the most technologically developed countries is now produced using automatic machines. Even automatic machines require human supervision."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Materials and manufacturing:6-8:The choice of materials for a job depends on their properties and on how they interact with other materials. Similarly, the usefulness of some manufactured parts of an object depends on how well they fit together with the other parts."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Materials and manufacturing:6-8:Manufacturing usually involves a series of steps, such as designing a product, obtaining and preparing raw materials, processing the materials mechanically or chemically, and assembling, testing, inspecting, and packaging. The sequence of these steps is also often important."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Materials and manufacturing:6-8:Modern technology reduces manufacturing costs, produces more uniform products, and creates new synthetic materials that can help reduce the depletion of some natural resources."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Materials and manufacturing:6-8:Automation, including the use of robots, has changed the nature of work in most fields, including manufacturing. As a result, high-skill, high-knowledge jobs in engineering, computer programming, quality control, supervision, and maintenance are replacing many routine, manual-labor jobs. Workers therefore need better learning skills and flexibility to take on new and rapidly changing jobs."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Materials and manufacturing:9-12:Manufacturing processes have been changed by improved tools and techniques based on more thorough scientific understanding, increases in the forces that can be applied and the temperatures that can be reached, and the availability of electronic controls that make operations occur more rapidly and consistently."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Materials and manufacturing:9-12:Waste management includes considerations of quantity, safety, degradability, and cost. It requires social and technological innovations, because waste-disposal problems are political and economic as well as technical."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Materials and manufacturing:9-12:Scientific research identifies new materials and new uses of known materials."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Materials and manufacturing:9-12:Increased knowledge of the molecular structure of materials helps in the design and synthesis of new materials for special purposes."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Energy sources and use:K-2:People can save money by turning off machines when they are not using them."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Energy sources and use:K-2:People burn fuels such as wood, oil, coal, or natural gas, or use electricity to cook their food and warm their houses."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Energy sources and use:3-5:Moving air and water can be used to run machines."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Energy sources and use:3-5:The sun is the main source of energy for people and they use it in various ways. The energy in fossil fuels such as oil and coal comes from the sun indirectly, because the fuels come from plants that grew long ago."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Energy sources and use:3-5:Some energy sources cost less than others and some cause less pollution than others."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Energy sources and use:3-5:People try to conserve energy in order to slow down the depletion of energy resources and/or to save money."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Energy sources and use:6-8:Energy can change from one form to another, although in the process some energy is always converted to heat. Some systems transform energy with less loss of heat than others."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Energy sources and use:6-8:Different ways of obtaining, transforming, and distributing energy have different environmental consequences."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Energy sources and use:6-8:In many instances, manufacturing and other technological activities are performed at a site close to an energy source. Some forms of energy are transported easily, others are not."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Energy sources and use:6-8:Electrical energy can be produced from a variety of energy sources and can be transformed into almost any other form of energy. Moreover, electricity is used to distribute energy quickly and conveniently to distant locations."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Energy sources and use:6-8:Energy from the sun (and the wind and water energy derived from it) is available indefinitely. Because the flow of energy is weak and variable, very large collection systems are needed. Other sources don't renew or renew only slowly."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Energy sources and use:6-8:Different parts of the world have different amounts and kinds of energy resources to use and use them for different purposes."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Energy sources and use:9-12:A central factor in technological change has been how hot a fire could be made. The discovery of new fuels, the design of better ovens and furnaces, and the forced delivery of air or pure oxygen have progressively increased the available temperature. Lasers are a new tool for focusing radiation energy with great intensity and control."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Energy sources and use:9-12:At present, all fuels have advantages and disadvantages so that society must consider the tradeoffs among them."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Energy sources and use:9-12:Nuclear reactions release energy without the combustion products of burning fuels, but the radioactivity of fuels and by-products poses other risks, which may last for thousands of years."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Energy sources and use:9-12:Industrialization brings an increased demand for and use of energy. Such usage contributes to the high standard of living in the industrially developing nations but also leads to more rapid depletion of the earth's energy resources and to environmental risks associated with the use of fossil and nuclear fuels."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Energy sources and use:9-12:Decisions to slow the depletion of energy sources through efficient technology can be made at many levels, from personal to national, and they always involve tradeoffs of economic costs and social values."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Communication:K-2:Information can be sent and received in many different ways. Some allow answering back and some do not. Each way has advantages and disadvantages."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Communication:K-2:Devices can be used to send and receive messages quickly and clearly."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Communication:3-5:People have always tried to communicate with one another. Signed and spoken language was one of the first inventions. Early forms of recording messages used markings on materials such as wood or stone."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Communication:3-5:Communication involves coding and decoding information. In any language, both the sender and the receiver have to know the same code, which means that secret codes can be used to keep communication private."/>
			<!--In the next benchmark, the phrase 'retrieved and be sent' originally had an m-dash between the words retrieved and and. The m-dash was changed to a space because then an entity reference does not need to be used in the XML.-->
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Communication:3-5:People have invented devices, such as paper and ink, engraved plastic disks, and magnetic tapes, for recording information. These devices enable great amounts of information to be stored and retrieved and be sent to one or many other people or places."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Communication:3-5:Communication technologies make it possible to send and receive information more and more reliably, quickly, and cheaply over long distances."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Communication:6-8:Errors can occur in coding, transmitting, or decoding information, and some means of checking for accuracy is needed. Repeating the message is a frequently used method."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Communication:6-8:Information can be carried by many media, including sound, light, and objects. In this century, the ability to code information as electric currents in wires, electromagnetic waves in space, and light in glass fibers has made communication millions of times faster than is possible by mail or sound."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Communication:9-12:Almost any information can be transformed into electrical signals. A weak electrical signal can be used to shape a stronger one, which can control other signals of light, sound, mechanical devices, or radio waves."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Communication:9-12:The quality of communication is determined by the strength of the signal in relation to the noise that tends to obscure it. Communication errors can be reduced by boosting and focusing signals, shielding the signal from internal and external noise, and repeating information, but all of these increase costs. Digital coding of information (using only 1's and 0's) makes possible more reliable transmission of information."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Communication:9-12:As technologies that provide privacy in communication improve, so do those for invading privacy."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Information processing:K-2:There are different ways to store things so they can be easily found later."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Information processing:K-2:Letters and numbers can be used to put things in a useful order."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Information processing:3-5:Computers are controlled partly by how they are wired and partly by special instructions called programs that are entered into a computer's memory. Some programs stay permanently in the machine but most are coded on disks and transferred into and out of the computer to suit the user."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Information processing:3-5:Computers can be programmed to store, retrieve, and perform operations on information. These operations include mathematical calculations, word processing, diagram drawing, and the modeling of complex events."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Information processing:3-5:Mistakes can occur when people enter programs or data into a computer. Computers themselves can make errors in information processing because of defects in their hardware or software."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Information processing:6-8:Most computers use digital codes containing only two symbols, 0 and 1, to perform all operations. Continuous signals (analog) must be transformed into digital codes before they can be processed by a computer."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Information processing:6-8:What use can be made of a large collection of information depends upon how it is organized. One of the values of computers is that they are able, on command, to reorganize information in a variety of ways, thereby enabling people to make more and better uses of the collection."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Information processing:6-8:Computer control of mechanical systems can be much quicker than human control. In situations where events happen faster than people can react, there is little choice but to rely on computers. Most complex systems still require human oversight, however, to make certain kinds of judgments about the readiness of the parts of the system (including the computers) and the system as a whole to operate properly, to react to unexpected failures, and to evaluate how well the system is serving its intended purposes."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Information processing:6-8:An increasing number of people work at jobs that involve processing or distributing information. Because computers can do these tasks faster and more reliably, they have become standard tools both in the workplace and at home."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Information processing:9-12:Computer modeling explores the logical consequences of a set of instructions and a set of data. The instructions and data input of a computer model try to represent the real world so the computer can show what would actually happen. In this way, computers assist people in making decisions by simulating the consequences of different possible decisions."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Information processing:9-12:Redundancy can reduce errors in storing or processing information but increases costs."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Information processing:9-12:Miniaturization of information-processing hardware can increase processing speed and portability, reduce energy use, and lower cost. Miniaturization is made possible through higher-purity materials and more precise fabrication technology."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Health technology:K-2:Vaccinations and other scientific treatments protect people from getting certain diseases, and different kinds of medicines may help those who do become sick to recover."/>
			<!--In the next benchmark, the phrases 'measurements, including'  and 'urine, that' originally had an m-dash rather than a comma between the words measurements and including and urine and that. The m-dash was changed to a comma because then an entity reference does not need to be used in the XML and a comma work grammatically well.-->
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Health technology:3-5:There are normal ranges for body measurements, including temperature, heart rate, and what is in the blood and urine, that help to tell when people are well. Tools, such as thermometers and x-ray machines, provide us clues about what is happening inside the body."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Health technology:3-5:Technology has made it possible to repair and sometimes replace some body parts."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Health technology:6-8:Sanitation measures such as the use of sewers, landfills, quarantines, and safe food handling are important in controlling the spread of organisms that cause disease. Improving sanitation to prevent disease has contributed more to saving human life than any advance in medical treatment."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Health technology:6-8:The ability to measure the level of substances in body fluids has made it possible for physicians to make comparisons with normal levels, make very sophisticated diagnoses, and monitor the effects of the treatments they prescribe."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Health technology:6-8:It is becoming increasingly possible to manufacture chemical substances such as insulin and hormones that are normally found in the body. They can be used by individuals whose own bodies cannot produce the amounts required for good health."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Health technology:9-12:Owing to the large amount of information that computers can process, they are playing an increasingly larger role in medicine. They are used to analyze data and to keep track of diagnostic information about individuals and statistical information on the distribution and spread of various maladies in populations."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Health technology:9-12:Almost all body substances and functions have daily or longer cycles. These cycles often need to be taken into account in interpreting normal ranges for body measurements, detecting disease, and planning treatment of illness. Computers aid in detecting, analyzing, and monitoring these cycles."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Health technology:9-12:Knowledge of genetics is opening whole new fields of health care. In diagnosis, mapping of genetic instructions in cells makes it possible to detect defective genes that may lead to poor health. In treatment, substances from genetically engineered organisms may reduce the cost and side effects of replacing missing body chemicals."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Health technology:9-12:Inoculations use weakened germs (or parts of them) to stimulate the body's immune system to react. This reaction prepares the body to fight subsequent invasions by actual germs of that type. Some inoculations last for life."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Health technology:9-12:Knowledge of molecular structure and interactions aids in synthesizing new drugs and predicting their effects."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Health technology:9-12:The diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders are improving but not as rapidly as for physical health. Techniques for detecting and diagnosing these disorders include observation of behavior, in-depth interviews, and measurements of body chemistry. Treatments range from conversation to affecting the brain physically with chemicals, electric shock, or surgery."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Designed world:Health technology:9-12:Biotechnology has contributed to health improvement in many ways, but its cost and application have led to a variety of controversial social and ethical issues."/>

			<xsd:enumeration value="People have always tried to communicate with one another. Signed and spoken language was one of the first inventions. Early forms of recording messages used markings on materials such as wood or stone."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="Communication involves coding and decoding information. In any language, both the sender and the receiver have to know the same code, which means that secret codes can be used to keep communication private."/>
			<!--In the next benchmark, the phrase 'retrieved and be sent' originally had an m-dash between the words retrieved and and. The m-dash was changed to a space because then an entity reference does not need to be used in the XML.-->
			<xsd:enumeration value="People have invented devices, such as paper and ink, engraved plastic disks, and magnetic tapes, for recording information. These devices enable great amounts of information to be stored and retrieved and be sent to one or many other people or places."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="Communication technologies make it possible to send and receive information more and more reliably, quickly, and cheaply over long distances."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="Errors can occur in coding, transmitting, or decoding information, and some means of checking for accuracy is needed. Repeating the message is a frequently used method."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="Information can be carried by many media, including sound, light, and objects. In this century, the ability to code information as electric currents in wires, electromagnetic waves in space, and light in glass fibers has made communication millions of times faster than is possible by mail or sound."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="Almost any information can be transformed into electrical signals. A weak electrical signal can be used to shape a stronger one, which can control other signals of light, sound, mechanical devices, or radio waves."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="The quality of communication is determined by the strength of the signal in relation to the noise that tends to obscure it. Communication errors can be reduced by boosting and focusing signals, shielding the signal from internal and external noise, and repeating information, but all of these increase costs. Digital coding of information (using only 1's and 0's) makes possible more reliable transmission of information."/>

			<xsd:enumeration value="Letters and numbers can be used to put things in a useful order."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="Computers are controlled partly by how they are wired and partly by special instructions called programs that are entered into a computer's memory. Some programs stay permanently in the machine but most are coded on disks and transferred into and out of the computer to suit the user."/>

			<xsd:enumeration value="Most computers use digital codes containing only two symbols, 0 and 1, to perform all operations. Continuous signals (analog) must be transformed into digital codes before they can be processed by a computer."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="What use can be made of a large collection of information depends upon how it is organized. One of the values of computers is that they are able, on command, to reorganize information in a variety of ways, thereby enabling people to make more and better uses of the collection."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="Computer control of mechanical systems can be much quicker than human control. In situations where events happen faster than people can react, there is little choice but to rely on computers. Most complex systems still require human oversight, however, to make certain kinds of judgments about the readiness of the parts of the system (including the computers) and the system as a whole to operate properly, to react to unexpected failures, and to evaluate how well the system is serving its intended purposes."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="An increasing number of people work at jobs that involve processing or distributing information. Because computers can do these tasks faster and more reliably, they have become standard tools both in the workplace and at home."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="Computer modeling explores the logical consequences of a set of instructions and a set of data. The instructions and data input of a computer model try to represent the real world so the computer can show what would actually happen. In this way, computers assist people in making decisions by simulating the consequences of different possible decisions."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="Redundancy can reduce errors in storing or processing information but increases costs."/>
