			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of science:The scientific world view:K-2:When a science investigation is done the way it was done before, we expect to get a very similar result."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of science:The scientific world view:K-2:Science investigations generally work the same way in different places."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of science:The scientific world view:3-5:Results of similar scientific investigations seldom turn out exactly the same. Sometimes this is because of unexpected differences in the things being investigated, sometimes because of unrealized differences in the methods used or in the circumstances in which the investigation is carried out, and sometimes just because of uncertainties in observations. It is not always easy to tell which."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of science:The scientific world view:6-8:When similar investigations give different results, the scientific challenge is to judge whether the differences are trivial or significant, and it often takes further studies to decide. Even with similar results, scientists may wait until an investigation has been repeated many times before accepting the results as correct."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of science:The scientific world view:6-8:Scientific knowledge is subject to modification as new information challenges prevailing theories and as a new theory leads to looking at old observations in a new way."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of science:The scientific world view:6-8:Some scientific knowledge is very old and yet is still applicable today."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of science:The scientific world view:6-8:Some matters cannot be examined usefully in a scientific way. Among them are matters that by their nature cannot be tested objectively and those that are essentially matters of morality. Science can sometimes be used to inform ethical decisions by identifying the likely consequences of particular actions but cannot be used to establish that some action is either moral or immoral."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of science:The scientific world view:9-12:Scientists assume that the universe is a vast single system in which the basic rules are the same everywhere. The rules may range from very simple to extremely complex, but scientists operate on the belief that the rules can be discovered by careful, systematic study."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of science:The scientific world view:9-12:From time to time, major shifts occur in the scientific view of how the world works. More often, however, the changes that take place in the body of scientific knowledge are small modifications of prior knowledge. Change and continuity are persistent features of science."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of science:The scientific world view:9-12:No matter how well one theory fits observations, a new theory might fit them just as well or better, or might fit a wider range of observations. In science, the testing, revising, and occasional discarding of theories, new and old, never ends. This ongoing process leads to an increasingly better understanding of how things work in the world but not to absolute truth. Evidence for the value of this approach is given by the improving ability of scientists to offer reliable explanations and make accurate predictions."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of science:Scientific inquiry:K-2:People can often learn about things around them by just observing those things carefully, but sometimes they can learn more by doing something to the things and noting what happens."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of science:Scientific inquiry:K-2:Tools such as thermometers, magnifiers, rulers, or balances often give more information about things than can be obtained by just observing things without their help."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of science:Scientific inquiry:K-2:Describing things as accurately as possible is important in science because it enables people to compare their observations with those of others."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of science:Scientific inquiry:K-2:When people give different descriptions of the same thing, it is usually a good idea to make some fresh observations instead of just arguing about who is right."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of science:Scientific inquiry:3-5:Scientific investigations may take many different forms, including observing what things are like or what is happening somewhere, collecting specimens for analysis, and doing experiments. Investigations can focus on physical, biological, and social questions."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of science:Scientific inquiry:3-5:Results of scientific investigations are seldom exactly the same, but if the differences are large, it is important to try to figure out why. One reason for following directions carefully and for keeping records of one's work is to provide information on what might have caused the differences."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of science:Scientific inquiry:3-5:Scientists' explanations about what happens in the world come partly from what they observe, partly from what they think. Sometimes scientists have different explanations for the same set of observations. That usually leads to their making more observations to resolve the differences."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of science:Scientific inquiry:3-5:Scientists do not pay much attention to claims about how something they know about works unless the claims are backed up with evidence that can be confirmed and with a logical argument."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of science:Scientific inquiry:6-8:Scientists differ greatly in what phenomena they study and how they go about their work. Although there is no fixed set of steps that all scientists follow, scientific investigations usually involve the collection of relevant evidence, the use of logical reasoning, and the application of imagination in devising hypotheses and explanations to make sense of the collected evidence."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of science:Scientific inquiry:6-8:If more than one variable changes at the same time in an experiment, the outcome of the experiment may not be clearly attributable to any one of the variables. It may not always be possible to prevent outside variables from influencing the outcome of an investigation (or even to identify all of the variables), but collaboration among investigators can often lead to research designs that are able to deal with such situations."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of science:Scientific inquiry:6-8:What people expect to observe often affects what they actually do observe. Strong beliefs about what should happen in particular circumstances can prevent them from detecting other results. Scientists know about this danger to objectivity and take steps to try and avoid it when designing investigations and examining data. One safeguard is to have different investigators conduct independent studies of the same questions."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of science:Scientific inquiry:6-8:New ideas in science sometimes spring from unexpected findings, and they usually lead to new investigations."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of science:Scientific inquiry:9-12:Investigations are conducted for different reasons, including to explore new phenomena, to check on previous results, to test how well a theory predicts, and to compare different theories."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of science:Scientific inquiry:9-12:Hypotheses are widely used in science for choosing what data to pay attention to and what additional data to seek, and for guiding the interpretation of the data (both new and previously available)."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of science:Scientific inquiry:9-12:Sometimes, scientists can control conditions in order to obtain evidence. When that is not possible for practical or ethical reasons, they try to observe as wide a range of natural occurrences as possible to be able to discern patterns."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of science:Scientific inquiry:9-12:There are different traditions in science about what is investigated and how, but they all have in common certain basic beliefs about the value of evidence, logic, and good arguments. And there is agreement that progress in all fields of science depends on intelligence, hard work, imagination, and even chance."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of science:Scientific inquiry:9-12:Scientists in any one research group tend to see things alike, so even groups of scientists may have trouble being entirely objective about their methods and findings. For that reason, scientific teams are expected to seek out the possible sources of bias in the design of their investigations and in their data analysis. Checking each other's results and explanations helps, but that is no guarantee against bias."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of science:Scientific inquiry:9-12:In the short run, new ideas that do not mesh well with mainstream ideas in science often encounter vigorous criticism. In the long run, theories are judged by how they fit with other theories, the range of observations they explain, how well they explain observations, and how effective they are in predicting new findings."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of science:Scientific inquiry:9-12:New ideas in science are limited by the context in which they are conceived; are often rejected by the scientific establishment; sometimes spring from unexpected findings; and usually grow slowly, through contributions from many investigators."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of science:The scientific enterprise:K-2:Everybody can do science and invent things and ideas."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of science:The scientific enterprise:K-2:In doing science, it is often helpful to work with a team and to share findings with others. All team members should reach their own individual conclusions, however, about what the findings mean."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of science:The scientific enterprise:K-2:A lot can be learned about plants and animals by observing them closely, but care must be taken to know the needs of living things and how to provide for them in the classroom."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of science:The scientific enterprise:3-5:Science is an adventure that people everywhere can take part in, as they have for many centuries."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of science:The scientific enterprise:3-5:Clear communication is an essential part of doing science. It enables scientists to inform others about their work, expose their ideas to criticism by other scientists, and stay informed about scientific discoveries around the world."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of science:The scientific enterprise:3-5:Doing science involves many different kinds of work and engages men and women of all ages and backgrounds."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of science:The scientific enterprise:6-8:Important contributions to the advancement of science, mathematics, and technology have been made by different kinds of people, in different cultures, at different times."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of science:The scientific enterprise:6-8:Until recently, women and racial minorities, because of restrictions on their education and employment opportunities, were essentially left out of much of the formal work of the science establishment; the remarkable few who overcame those obstacles were even then likely to have their work disregarded by the science establishment."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of science:The scientific enterprise:6-8:No matter who does science and mathematics or invents things, or when or where they do it, the knowledge and technology that result can eventually become available to everyone in the world."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of science:The scientific enterprise:6-8:Scientists are employed by colleges and universities, business and industry, hospitals, and many government agencies. Their places of work include offices, classrooms, laboratories, farms, factories, and natural field settings ranging from space to the ocean floor."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of science:The scientific enterprise:6-8:In research involving human subjects, the ethics of science require that potential subjects be fully informed about the risks and benefits associated with the research and of their right to refuse to participate. Science ethics also demand that scientists must not knowingly subject coworkers, students, the neighborhood, or the community to health or property risks without their prior knowledge and consent. Because animals cannot make informed choices, special care must be taken in using them in scientific research."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of science:The scientific enterprise:6-8:Computers have become invaluable in science because they speed up and extend people's ability to collect, store, compile, and analyze data, prepare research reports, and share data and ideas with investigators all over the world."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of science:The scientific enterprise:6-8:Accurate record-keeping, openness, and replication are essential for maintaining an investigator's credibility with other scientists and society."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of science:The scientific enterprise:9-12:The early Egyptian, Greek, Chinese, Hindu, and Arabic cultures are responsible for many scientific and mathematical ideas and technological inventions."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of science:The scientific enterprise:9-12:Modern science is based on traditions of thought that came together in Europe about 500 years ago. People from all cultures now contribute to that tradition."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of science:The scientific enterprise:9-12:Progress in science and invention depends heavily on what else is happening in society, and history often depends on scientific and technological developments."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of science:The scientific enterprise:9-12:Science disciplines differ from one another in what is studied, techniques used, and outcomes sought, but they share a common purpose and philosophy, and all are part of the same scientific enterprise. Although each discipline provides a conceptual structure for organizing and pursuing knowledge, many problems are studied by scientists using information and skills from many disciplines. Disciplines do not have fixed boundaries, and it happens that new scientific disciplines are being formed where existing ones meet and that some subdisciplines spin off to become new disciplines in their own right."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of science:The scientific enterprise:9-12:Current ethics in science hold that research involving human subjects may be conducted only with the informed consent of the subjects, even if this constraint limits some kinds of potentially important research or influences the results. When it comes to participation in research that could pose risks to society, most scientists believe that a decision to participate or not is a matter of personal ethics rather than professional ethics."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of science:The scientific enterprise:9-12:Scientists can bring information, insights, and analytical skills to bear on matters of public concern. Acting in their areas of expertise, scientists can help people understand the likely causes of events and estimate their possible effects. Outside their areas of expertise, however, scientists should enjoy no special credibility. And where their own personal, institutional, or community interests are at stake, scientists as a group can be expected to be no less biased than other groups are about their perceived interests."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of science:The scientific enterprise:9-12:The strongly held traditions of science, including its commitment to peer review and publication, serve to keep the vast majority of scientists well within the bounds of ethical professional behavior. Deliberate deceit is rare and likely to be exposed sooner or later by the scientific enterprise itself. When violations of these scientific ethical traditions are discovered, they are strongly condemned by the scientific community, and the violators then have difficulty regaining the respect of other scientists."/>
			<xsd:enumeration value="AAASbenchmarks:Nature of science:The scientific enterprise:9-12:Funding influences the direction of science by virtue of the decisions that are made on which research to support. Research funding comes from various federal government agencies, industry, and private foundations."/>
