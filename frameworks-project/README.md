# XML Frameworks Project

The Frameworks Project contains XML frameworks that are used for describing educational resources, annotations, use data (paradata), and other data and objects.

The project contains XML schemas, XSL transforms, scripts, and configurations that are hosted at dlese.org. [View the frameworks and related documentation at DLESE](http://www.dlese.org/Metadata/).

Note: The operational version of these schemas are managed in a separate GitHub repository https://github.com/NCAR/dlese-web-view/tree/master/Metadata.
